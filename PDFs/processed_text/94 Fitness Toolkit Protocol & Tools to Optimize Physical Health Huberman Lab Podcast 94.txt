00:04:35 Tool: Soleus (Calf) Push-Ups, Glucose Utilization & Metabolism

supporting regular Huberman Lab podcast. Again,
hubermanlab.com/premium. dive today's content fitness fitness
protocols, want tell brand new study exciting frankly
unusual. study published University Houston, examining
call micro exercise micro movement. small movement
small portion body, fact, just 1% musculature,
performed continuously seated has, least report, dramatic
positive changes terms blood sugar utilization metabolism. title
study "A potent physiological method magnify sustain soleus oxidative
metabolism improves glucose lipid regulation." study published
iScience, mentioned earlier, getting lot attention unusual.


Without going details study, let just briefly give little bit
background. First all, muscle called soleus. soleus muscle
less wide flat muscle sits beneath people think calf,
although part calf muscle. portion calf called
gastrocnemius. soleus sits that. Now, soleus muscle unique muscle
largely slow twitch muscle fibers. designed used continuously
stabilizing body standing upright, walking.
muscle designed contract again. fact,
walk day muscle likely not get sore. probably done
not get sore. contrast, muscle like bicep tricep,
perform hundreds thousands repetitions, even lightweight one
pound weight two pound weight, eventually fatigue. feel sort
burn there. unusual set muscles use repeatedly. soleus
unusual muscle really designed used continuously. Now, study
focused people sit lot day don't opportunity lot
physical movement maybe don't even exercise can improve
metabolism glucose utilization. Without going deep dive glucose
utilization, done deep dive podcast, episodes
metabolism, et cetera, can look hubermanlab.com.
timestamped available there. Anytime eat, blood sugar goes
extent. blood glucose, called, goes extent. insulin
hormone used essentially chaperone sequester use blood
glucose basically idea don't want blood glucose go high.
Hyperinsulinemia something associated blood glucose high
insulin goes essentially match level blood glucose. don't also don't want
hypoglycemic, don't want blood sugar low, insulin
involved regulating peaks troughs blood sugar, blood glucose. can
basically say, simple, can basically say don't want blood
glucose elevated much long. not good. fact, people
diabetes don't make insulin, people type 1 diabetes not
make insulin all, blood glucose high actually take insulin
order regulate otherwise blood glucose can go high can damage cells
damage organs. can even kill people. People type 2 diabetes
called insulin insensitive. make insulin, receptors insulin not sensitive


it, make insulin normally made blood glucose
isn't regulated properly, et cetera, et cetera. take home message blood
glucose want blood glucose levels go eat, not
high don't want stay elevated long. study looked
people largely sedentary least sitting can increase utilization,
clearance glucose bloodstream eating, also looked overall
metabolism. people, get this, using just 1% muscle, soleus,
call soleus pushup. soleus pushup can described
simply sitting knee bent approximately right angle, like
square corner, pushing up, say lifting heel pushing
toe contracting calf muscle were, lowering heel
lifting heel again, lowering heel, lifting heel again, one
call soleus pushup. study people continuously soleus pushups
looked things like blood glucose utilization, looked metabolism
on. Now, couple important things study tell
discovered, frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard believe, yet
believe data looked collected quite well, lot statistics
study looks quite thorough. First all, used equal number male
female subjects. wide range body mass indices, okay? wasn't
just super fit people people purely sedentary not fit. used wide
variety ages, time day, people tended walk lot not walk lot.
measured changes metabolism blood glucose utilization people
done soleus pushups seated laboratory, must say,
soleus pushups quite long while, continuously.
long 270 minutes total throughout day. divide that, four
half hours, might say, well, four half hours lifting heel putting
heel down, lifting heel, putting heel down, lot. didn't always
continuously. breaks there. sort thing
imagine people seated, Zooms
calls maybe even eating, sort thing. Although not suggesting
constantly focusing soleus pushups throughout life. point
people soleus pushups experienced dramatic improvements blood
sugar regulation metabolism despite fact soleus just 1% total
musculature. going read abstract found, people


soleus pushups, despite tiny muscle using little local
energy... fact, measured muscle glycogen, burn essentially utilization
fuel within muscle, little utilization fuel within soleus
itself, soleus unique property needing basically
keep going day, walking day moving day. saw large
magnitude, example, 52% less postprandial, meal, glucose excursion,
52% less increase blood glucose 60%, six zero less hyper insulinemia,
reduced levels insulin. also, miraculously, observed despite being,
again, small muscle, 1% total muscle mass, small oxidative use,
saw big improvements systemic metabolic regulation. interesting think
something least know about. not aware anyone's replicated
study yet. know ton excitement study popular press,
data turn hold up, like imagine will, can understand
much excitement. means somebody cares
blood glucose regulation, want keep metabolism running, please don't
stop exercising, ways exercise. somebody wants
maximize health, soleus pushups fairly continuously seated
going beneficial. addition that, know going people
who, instance, might injured traveling stuck
plane classroom forced study day take notes day.
just not getting enough opportunity get steps want take,
whether 10,000 fewer more, getting enough steps movement. Maybe
don't time get run, maybe also running,
weightlifting yoga classes things sort, want
improve fitness, least terms metabolic health. seems like terrific,
low investment way it. Certainly zero cost. take little bit attention,
divert attention things make sure
still soleus pushups. sure many going lot
detailed questions high lift heel contract
muscle hard not? Couple things that, not subjects really
contract muscle hard. measure angle heel raise anywhere
10 15 degrees didn't go way, way tippy toes things
sort. event, 270 minutes, four half hours soleus
pushups lot, read data rather significant, say


significant effects observed blood glucose regulation metabolism,
et cetera, seems less still beneficial don't
necessarily full 270 minutes order get benefits
observed. study includes fact benefits observed
long lasting, long two hours meal, still see improved
blood glucose utilization. don't know wasn't able find methods
whether not soleus pushups consuming blood
sugar study. point somebody cares
fitness, study interesting, means that, again, forced
immobile sitting longer like, stuck meeting Zooms
class plane, et cetera, simply trying add bit fitness
metabolic health overall regimen, soleus pushups, least me, seem like
low investment, simple, zero cost tool improve metabolic health.

00:18:53 Core Principles Fitness & Modifiable Variables

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk fitness talk can
develop optimal fitness protocols you. includes day
week fitness protocol across week, indeed across month
year even year year. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast, said
something important want keep mind today, concepts few,
methods many, infinite number different programs
exercises set rep schemes different runs burpees pushups, et
cetera, et cetera one can follow. However, really just basic concepts
principles muscle physiology, cardiovascular function, connective tissue
function provide set basis adaptations call fitness lead
fitness. going list off now. can talk fitness protocol
really aimed mainly toward developing skill. one. speed. another.
power, speed times strength, specifically strength, hypertrophy, growth
muscles, endurance muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is,
instance, ability stay plank position wall sit, sit invisible
chair wall, forms endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance.
one minute sprint less one minute cycling stationary bike, sort
thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.
forth. people, believe, like combination strength
endurance flexibility maybe even hypertrophy, particularly certain
muscle groups maybe not well developed muscle groups. want


bring balance physique, sake aesthetics sake health

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent

Without going details study, let just briefly give little bit
background. First all, muscle called soleus. soleus muscle
less wide flat muscle sits beneath people think calf,
although part calf muscle. portion calf called
gastrocnemius. soleus sits that. Now, soleus muscle unique muscle
largely slow twitch muscle fibers. designed used continuously
stabilizing body standing upright, walking.
muscle designed contract again. fact,
walk day muscle likely not get sore. probably done
not get sore. contrast, muscle like bicep tricep,
perform hundreds thousands repetitions, even lightweight one
pound weight two pound weight, eventually fatigue. feel sort
burn there. unusual set muscles use repeatedly. soleus
unusual muscle really designed used continuously. Now, study
focused people sit lot day don't opportunity lot
physical movement maybe don't even exercise can improve
metabolism glucose utilization. Without going deep dive glucose
utilization, done deep dive podcast, episodes
metabolism, et cetera, can look hubermanlab.com.
timestamped available there. Anytime eat, blood sugar goes
extent. blood glucose, called, goes extent. insulin
hormone used essentially chaperone sequester use blood
glucose basically idea don't want blood glucose go high.
Hyperinsulinemia something associated blood glucose high
insulin goes essentially match level blood glucose. don't also don't want
hypoglycemic, don't want blood sugar low, insulin
involved regulating peaks troughs blood sugar, blood glucose. can
basically say, simple, can basically say don't want blood
glucose elevated much long. not good. fact, people
diabetes don't make insulin, people type 1 diabetes not
make insulin all, blood glucose high actually take insulin
order regulate otherwise blood glucose can go high can damage cells
damage organs. can even kill people. People type 2 diabetes
called insulin insensitive. make insulin, receptors insulin not sensitive


it, make insulin normally made blood glucose
isn't regulated properly, et cetera, et cetera. take home message blood
glucose want blood glucose levels go eat, not
high don't want stay elevated long. study looked
people largely sedentary least sitting can increase utilization,
clearance glucose bloodstream eating, also looked overall
metabolism. people, get this, using just 1% muscle, soleus,
call soleus pushup. soleus pushup can described
simply sitting knee bent approximately right angle, like
square corner, pushing up, say lifting heel pushing
toe contracting calf muscle were, lowering heel
lifting heel again, lowering heel, lifting heel again, one
call soleus pushup. study people continuously soleus pushups
looked things like blood glucose utilization, looked metabolism
on. Now, couple important things study tell
discovered, frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard believe, yet
believe data looked collected quite well, lot statistics
study looks quite thorough. First all, used equal number male
female subjects. wide range body mass indices, okay? wasn't
just super fit people people purely sedentary not fit. used wide
variety ages, time day, people tended walk lot not walk lot.
measured changes metabolism blood glucose utilization people
done soleus pushups seated laboratory, must say,
soleus pushups quite long while, continuously.
long 270 minutes total throughout day. divide that, four
half hours, might say, well, four half hours lifting heel putting
heel down, lifting heel, putting heel down, lot. didn't always
continuously. breaks there. sort thing
imagine people seated, Zooms
calls maybe even eating, sort thing. Although not suggesting
constantly focusing soleus pushups throughout life. point
people soleus pushups experienced dramatic improvements blood
sugar regulation metabolism despite fact soleus just 1% total
musculature. going read abstract found, people


soleus pushups, despite tiny muscle using little local
energy... fact, measured muscle glycogen, burn essentially utilization
fuel within muscle, little utilization fuel within soleus
itself, soleus unique property needing basically
keep going day, walking day moving day. saw large
magnitude, example, 52% less postprandial, meal, glucose excursion,
52% less increase blood glucose 60%, six zero less hyper insulinemia,
reduced levels insulin. also, miraculously, observed despite being,
again, small muscle, 1% total muscle mass, small oxidative use,
saw big improvements systemic metabolic regulation. interesting think
something least know about. not aware anyone's replicated
study yet. know ton excitement study popular press,
data turn hold up, like imagine will, can understand
much excitement. means somebody cares
blood glucose regulation, want keep metabolism running, please don't
stop exercising, ways exercise. somebody wants
maximize health, soleus pushups fairly continuously seated
going beneficial. addition that, know going people
who, instance, might injured traveling stuck
plane classroom forced study day take notes day.
just not getting enough opportunity get steps want take,
whether 10,000 fewer more, getting enough steps movement. Maybe
don't time get run, maybe also running,
weightlifting yoga classes things sort, want
improve fitness, least terms metabolic health. seems like terrific,
low investment way it. Certainly zero cost. take little bit attention,
divert attention things make sure
still soleus pushups. sure many going lot
detailed questions high lift heel contract
muscle hard not? Couple things that, not subjects really
contract muscle hard. measure angle heel raise anywhere
10 15 degrees didn't go way, way tippy toes things
sort. event, 270 minutes, four half hours soleus
pushups lot, read data rather significant, say


significant effects observed blood glucose regulation metabolism,
et cetera, seems less still beneficial don't
necessarily full 270 minutes order get benefits
observed. study includes fact benefits observed
long lasting, long two hours meal, still see improved
blood glucose utilization. don't know wasn't able find methods
whether not soleus pushups consuming blood
sugar study. point somebody cares
fitness, study interesting, means that, again, forced
immobile sitting longer like, stuck meeting Zooms
class plane, et cetera, simply trying add bit fitness
metabolic health overall regimen, soleus pushups, least me, seem like
low investment, simple, zero cost tool improve metabolic health.
want peruse study

00:18:53 Core Principles Fitness & Modifiable Variables

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk fitness talk can
develop optimal fitness protocols you. includes day
week fitness protocol across week, indeed across month
year even year year. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast, said
something important want keep mind today, concepts few,
methods many, infinite number different programs
exercises set rep schemes different runs burpees pushups, et
cetera, et cetera one can follow. However, really just basic concepts
principles muscle physiology, cardiovascular function, connective tissue
function provide set basis adaptations call fitness lead
fitness. going list off now. can talk fitness protocol
really aimed mainly toward developing skill. one. speed. another.
power, speed times strength, specifically strength, hypertrophy, growth
muscles, endurance muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is,
instance, ability stay plank position wall sit, sit invisible
chair wall, forms endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance.
one minute sprint less one minute cycling stationary bike, sort
thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.
forth. people, believe, like combination strength
endurance flexibility maybe even hypertrophy, particularly certain
muscle groups maybe not well developed muscle groups. want


bring balance physique, sake aesthetics sake health

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments

it, make insulin normally made blood glucose
isn't regulated properly, et cetera, et cetera. take home message blood
glucose want blood glucose levels go eat, not
high don't want stay elevated long. study looked
people largely sedentary least sitting can increase utilization,
clearance glucose bloodstream eating, also looked overall
metabolism. people, get this, using just 1% muscle, soleus,
call soleus pushup. soleus pushup can described
simply sitting knee bent approximately right angle, like
square corner, pushing up, say lifting heel pushing
toe contracting calf muscle were, lowering heel
lifting heel again, lowering heel, lifting heel again, one
call soleus pushup. study people continuously soleus pushups
looked things like blood glucose utilization, looked metabolism
on. Now, couple important things study tell
discovered, frankly pretty miraculous, almost hard believe, yet
believe data looked collected quite well, lot statistics
study looks quite thorough. First all, used equal number male
female subjects. wide range body mass indices, okay? wasn't
just super fit people people purely sedentary not fit. used wide
variety ages, time day, people tended walk lot not walk lot.
measured changes metabolism blood glucose utilization people
done soleus pushups seated laboratory, must say,
soleus pushups quite long while, continuously.
long 270 minutes total throughout day. divide that, four
half hours, might say, well, four half hours lifting heel putting
heel down, lifting heel, putting heel down, lot. didn't always
continuously. breaks there. sort thing
imagine people seated, Zooms
calls maybe even eating, sort thing. Although not suggesting
constantly focusing soleus pushups throughout life. point
people soleus pushups experienced dramatic improvements blood
sugar regulation metabolism despite fact soleus just 1% total
musculature. going read abstract found, people


soleus pushups, despite tiny muscle using little local
energy... fact, measured muscle glycogen, burn essentially utilization
fuel within muscle, little utilization fuel within soleus
itself, soleus unique property needing basically
keep going day, walking day moving day. saw large
magnitude, example, 52% less postprandial, meal, glucose excursion,
52% less increase blood glucose 60%, six zero less hyper insulinemia,
reduced levels insulin. also, miraculously, observed despite being,
again, small muscle, 1% total muscle mass, small oxidative use,
saw big improvements systemic metabolic regulation. interesting think
something least know about. not aware anyone's replicated
study yet. know ton excitement study popular press,
data turn hold up, like imagine will, can understand
much excitement. means somebody cares
blood glucose regulation, want keep metabolism running, please don't
stop exercising, ways exercise. somebody wants
maximize health, soleus pushups fairly continuously seated
going beneficial. addition that, know going people
who, instance, might injured traveling stuck
plane classroom forced study day take notes day.
just not getting enough opportunity get steps want take,
whether 10,000 fewer more, getting enough steps movement. Maybe
don't time get run, maybe also running,
weightlifting yoga classes things sort, want
improve fitness, least terms metabolic health. seems like terrific,
low investment way it. Certainly zero cost. take little bit attention,
divert attention things make sure
still soleus pushups. sure many going lot
detailed questions high lift heel contract
muscle hard not? Couple things that, not subjects really
contract muscle hard. measure angle heel raise anywhere
10 15 degrees didn't go way, way tippy toes things
sort. event, 270 minutes, four half hours soleus
pushups lot, read data rather significant, say


significant effects observed blood glucose regulation metabolism,
et cetera, seems less still beneficial don't
necessarily full 270 minutes order get benefits
observed. study includes fact benefits observed
long lasting, long two hours meal, still see improved
blood glucose utilization. don't know wasn't able find methods
whether not soleus pushups consuming blood
sugar study. point somebody cares
fitness, study interesting, means that, again, forced
immobile sitting longer like, stuck meeting Zooms
class plane, et cetera, simply trying add bit fitness
metabolic health overall regimen, soleus pushups, least me, seem like
low investment, simple, zero cost tool improve metabolic health.

00:18:53 Core Principles Fitness & Modifiable Variables

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk fitness talk can
develop optimal fitness protocols you. includes day
week fitness protocol across week, indeed across month
year even year year. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast, said
something important want keep mind today, concepts few,
methods many, infinite number different programs
exercises set rep schemes different runs burpees pushups, et
cetera, et cetera one can follow. However, really just basic concepts
principles muscle physiology, cardiovascular function, connective tissue
function provide set basis adaptations call fitness lead
fitness. going list off now. can talk fitness protocol
really aimed mainly toward developing skill. one. speed. another.
power, speed times strength, specifically strength, hypertrophy, growth
muscles, endurance muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is,
instance, ability stay plank position wall sit, sit invisible
chair wall, forms endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance.
one minute sprint less one minute cycling stationary bike, sort
thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.
forth. people, believe, like combination strength
endurance flexibility maybe even hypertrophy, particularly certain
muscle groups maybe not well developed muscle groups. want


bring balance physique, sake aesthetics sake health

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end

00:18:53 Core Principles Fitness & Modifiable Variables

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk fitness talk can
develop optimal fitness protocols you. includes day
week fitness protocol across week, indeed across month
year even year year. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast, said
something important want keep mind today, concepts few,
methods many, infinite number different programs
exercises set rep schemes different runs burpees pushups, et
cetera, et cetera one can follow. However, really just basic concepts
principles muscle physiology, cardiovascular function, connective tissue
function provide set basis adaptations call fitness lead
fitness. going list off now. can talk fitness protocol
really aimed mainly toward developing skill. one. speed. another.
power, speed times strength, specifically strength, hypertrophy, growth
muscles, endurance muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is,
instance, ability stay plank position wall sit, sit invisible
chair wall, forms endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance.
one minute sprint less one minute cycling stationary bike, sort
thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.

experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day

sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time

one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.
forth. people, believe, like combination strength
endurance flexibility maybe even hypertrophy, particularly certain
muscle groups maybe not well developed muscle groups. want


bring balance physique, sake aesthetics sake health

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day

sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time

one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end

breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments

00:18:53 Core Principles Fitness & Modifiable Variables

supplements constantly expanding. Again,
livemomentous.com/huberman. talk fitness talk can
develop optimal fitness protocols you. includes day
week fitness protocol across week, indeed across month
year even year year. Dr. Andy Galpin podcast, said
something important want keep mind today, concepts few,
methods many, infinite number different programs
exercises set rep schemes different runs burpees pushups, et
cetera, et cetera one can follow. However, really just basic concepts
principles muscle physiology, cardiovascular function, connective tissue
function provide set basis adaptations call fitness lead
fitness. going list off now. can talk fitness protocol
really aimed mainly toward developing skill. one. speed. another.
power, speed times strength, specifically strength, hypertrophy, growth
muscles, endurance muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is,
instance, ability stay plank position wall sit, sit invisible
chair wall, forms endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance.
one minute sprint less one minute cycling stationary bike, sort
thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.
forth. people, believe, like combination strength
endurance flexibility maybe even hypertrophy, particularly certain
muscle groups maybe not well developed muscle groups. want


bring balance physique, sake aesthetics sake health

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day

sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end

breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments

power, speed times strength, specifically strength, hypertrophy, growth
muscles, endurance muscular endurance. Muscular endurance is,
instance, ability stay plank position wall sit, sit invisible
chair wall, forms endurance like near pure anaerobic endurance.
one minute sprint less one minute cycling stationary bike, sort
thing, endurance occurs kind 3 12 minute total duration range.
might sprints high intensity interval type training. swim,
row. another form endurance, taps different fuel systems,


different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set
base layer, foundation everything talk today. need
think modifiable variables? Again, borrowing directly
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. one said, modifiable variables key
thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive
overload. Normally people hear progressive overload, think
adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et
cetera, covered podcast Dr. Andy Galpin
podcast experts mentioned earlier. again, will provide links
podcasts want drill mechanisms. Instead, going
going start program essentially designed maximize
aspects fitness extent can simultaneously maximize aspects
fitness, change modify protocol want build more,
instance, strength want just hold onto endurance have, don't
want build endurance, least not week month, can that.
want improve endurance maintaining strength, can that.
forth. people, believe, like combination strength
endurance flexibility maybe even hypertrophy, particularly certain
muscle groups maybe not well developed muscle groups. want


bring balance physique, sake aesthetics sake health

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day

sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time

one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

different aspects muscle physiology, et cetera. endurance lasts 30
minutes more, typically people think think
endurance. course, forms endurance matter. got skill,
speed, power, strength, hypertrophy, muscular endurance, anaerobic endurance,
call 3 12 minute endurance, although goes names well, 30
minutes endurance type exercise adaptations. every one
requires different principles, different concepts order improve, say muscular
strength hypertrophy both. However, general theme sits beneath
adaptations leading fitness, really going set

thing think about. going modify? going change
order increase one various things listed off before, skill, speed,
power, strength, hypertrophy, endurance, et cetera, et cetera. key
concepts emerge discussion need think progressive

adding weight bar picking heavier dumbbells, also
progressive overload context running hill steeper incline running
little bit faster little bit forth. Now, promised earlier,
today not going drill every one mechanisms underlie
different adaptations going develop speed strength endurance, et

muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day

sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

00:23:37 Day 1: Long Endurance Workout

sake general functioning, maybe even eliminate pain, protocol
going describe really works foundational template well. drill
foundational protocol keep referring foundational protocol, not
one use, although one use, not
one talking today, although one talking today,
need general framework build specific
protocols get bit detail later. foundational protocol
fitness, notice one given day, going focus one
particular aspect fitness. Maybe endurance, maybe strength, maybe
hypertrophy, particular, might hypertrophy particular muscle group
muscle groups. said, across entire week, designed bring fitness
different forms fitness aspects body. particular protocol begins
Sunday, although simply day happen begin protocol. again,
protocol not important one follow. follow
important. words, protocol really gleaned scientific literature
experts, you. fitness protocol really you. just may
refer one follow simply ease communication. me,
week begins Sunday. best get workout Sunday.
me, workout endurance workout. designed either maintain
increase endurance, endurance type referring endurance 30
minutes more. fact, me, goal always get either 60 75 minutes
jogging. so-called zone two cardio, people probably heard zone
two cardio, haven't, okay. Zone two cardio something
measure heart rate monitor device, don't need to. Zone two
cardio kind cardiovascular exercise pushing move
breathing faster normal, heart beating faster normal,
however, still able sustain conversation. push
harder, move faster go steeper incline rate happen
one moment, lose ability speak, wouldn't able
complete sentences, breath pause mid-sentence.


Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day

sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean

Now, near impossible, even heart rate monitor, stay exactly zone two
unless very, skilled that. don't obsess that, fact don't
wear heart rate monitor exercise, me, goal head
Sunday get 60 75 minutes jogging zone two. Now course like jog,
doesn't mean jog. replace jogging rowing
rowing machine maybe even rowing actual boat access
cycling swimming, something allows continuous movement 60 75
minutes zone two threshold talked earlier. me, can include
hills, say hills, steep hills, simply slow pace
order stay roughly zone two range.
low grade hills might just slow little bit might even push tiny bit
day. really just trying build long endurance. trying build
capacity maintain capacity go long distance without fatiguing. Now
days, meaning Sundays, since tend almost always Sunday,
although exceptions, instead 60 75 minute jog,
will head long hike two half hours three hours maybe
even four five hour hike. Sometimes long. sometimes simply
mix routine, sometimes jogging jogging routes gets
boring me. enjoy running, something long time,
sometimes just gets little bit tedious want something different. Also,
sometimes want social Sundays. want head hike partner
want meet friends hike them. taking long hike
Sunday something also quite social. don't worry
also getting workout heading hike partner going
meet friends things sort. will say specific tool specific
change can make Sunday long endurance, least consider
long me, mean no means marathon Ironman, long endurance
training, use weight vest. something really started utilizing
recently, recently, really mean within last year so,
purchased one weight vests can anywhere 10 50 pounds.
use weight vest irrelevant. certainly changes level effort required
taking hike even walk. Now additional benefit weight vest,
going hike even walk social reasons
somebody not quite fitness level are, frankly


little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks

seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance

endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

little bit rude just keep walking ahead running back running ahead
running back. Oftentimes really want spend time person don't
want feel holding up. weight vest terrific way
get additional work, then, find wear weight vest, additional
work on, say, shorter hike. maybe person time hour
long hike, maybe just don't fitness two hour, three hour hike.
throw weight vest head walk hike them,
sometimes go long hike weight vest myself. again, point this,
me, Sunday, although fall day you, workout, really build
long form endurance. fits well Dr. Andy Galpin Dr. Peter Attia
referred real need get long endurance type work point
even multiple points throughout week. me, long Sunday jog 60 75
minutes long Sunday hike weighted walk weighted hike really accomplishes
goal. Sometimes leads little bit soreness, particularly calves
wearing weight vest, sometimes midsection will get sore trying
remain upright. think also builds muscular endurance, not just
cardiovascular endurance, again, throughout entire time jogging
hiking, trying get place can feel pulse rate definitely
elevated, not elevated stop breath.
know people might really neurotic sort thing,
stop breath, doesn't mean blew
workout, now aren't getting endurance. course, getting benefits
it. not absolutely neurotic always staying exactly heart rate zone.
might stop conversation moment longer hike, although really try
keep moving try push just little bit
exceedingly comfortable. me, long Sunday hike jog really
provides foundation, base endurance endurance workouts
describe later, take place later week, can build on. Now, mentioned
earlier, will get back mechanisms taps useful.
multiple benefits kinds endurance type workouts zone two
cardio. putting start week, again, week starts Sunday,
sure regardless rest week goes, got endurance training
in, course going want to, will endurance training days
week, something comes happen get sick really behind terms


work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

work can't get workouts in, Sunday long jog hike really provides
fundamental, can honestly say foundation, cardiovascular fitness endurance
can hang hat say, okay, got one bag, can look
days week focus aspects fitness. Now, really important
point make Sunday endurance workout allows check off box
box 75 minutes zone two cardio, may heard,
either podcast others like Dr. Peter Attia, getting 180 200
minutes zone two cardio per week enormous positive effects longevity
enormous positive effects general health, again, terms cardiovascular function,
also metabolic fuel utilization, also terms musculature ability
use body long distances long periods time. doesn't complete
180 200 minutes per week, certainly gets good distance, pun intended,
toward goal. Now, want acknowledge people might starting
fitness program, 60 75 minutes jogging might long three hour
weight vested hike, people might even called ruck, like wear
rucksack, might much, case certainly start less go flat
ground go rate allows get zone two, not excessively
difficult you. build fitness, can add time can add
weight weight vest, don't want buy weight vest can't afford
one, simple solution that, actually good anecdote that. One
time heading hike friend mine, former SEAL team
operator, never forget this, said, oh yeah, "I'll bring sack." thought
meant like sack lunch, like going bring lunch. showed
basically gave backpack loaded bunch stuff backpack
weighed 40 pounds. took hike. thinking lunch,
thinking weighted backpack, weighted backpack even just kind strong sack
can put shoulders even carry arms, going work
exceedingly well build extra requirement effort. certainly don't
purchase weight vest order get benefits bringing additional weight along
long cardiovascular events. again, build time, can add
time, can add weight, also really nice feature adding weight,
point schedule might such, just don't really want keep adding
time long endurance Sunday, case, workout,
case add weight. can also, build fitness, can add speed it,


zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday
no endurance, no resistance training day, doesn't mean not

cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold

don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

zone two zone two won't shift, work required
order get zone two will shift. get fit,
move faster bring weight

00:34:38 Day 2: Leg Resistance Training, Strength & Hypertrophy

order stay zone two will simply tell indeed improving
endurance. Okay, Monday rolls around I, like everyone else
there, work Monday, get right emails preparation podcasts
running laboratory, et cetera. However, make sure point Monday,
point typically ideally early morning, 7:00 so,
train legs Monday, includes quadriceps, hamstrings, calves.
workout Monday? workout designed do? Well,
workout really designed make sure either maintaining building strength
legs. not simply aesthetic reasons. not simply grow bigger
calves grow bigger quadriceps hamstrings, although can accomplish
well depending train. talk details training. reason
training legs Monday several fold. First all, largest muscle groups
body, training legs Monday, sets motion large number
metabolic processes carry distance even whole week
terms elevating metabolism, terms amplifying certain hormonal events
body, et cetera, really beneficial. addition that, belief legs
foundation body, provided can train legs safely, training legs
vitally important, not just strength legs, also strength entire
body. Again, systemic hormonal effects going
train large muscle groups body substantial loads, will get
systemic release hormones, not just testosterone, although certainly testosterone,
also things like growth hormone... get increases sorts so-called anabolic
hormones even somebody not trying increase muscle size,
realize lot people not trying that, hormones shift
metabolism overall tendon strength ligament strength overall
musculature call strong foundation. me, Monday leg
workout. also just feels good get leg workout way earlier week,
accomplishes another goal, sometimes will take one two days off


leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday
no endurance, no resistance training day, doesn't mean not
anything overall health fitness. Tuesdays, series heat cold
contrast. words, get really, really warm get really, really cold, get
really, really warm get really, really cold repeatedly. way

Fahrenheit. Again, don't get water cold go shock. explain
good cold stimulus determine that. don't
access sauna ice bath, can traveling will take hot bath
alternate cold shower, hot bath, cold shower. hard hot bath ice
bath unless two baths. don't know hotel rooms, least never stayed
one two baths, although sure there. me, heat
cold contrast. really day two things. First all, trying
accelerate recovery leg workout previously. Also, listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate heat exposure listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate cold exposure, talk
benefits heat cold, get lot details can
access heat. can baths, can saunas, can even take hot showers.
don't access that, even wrap body neck
garbage bag, plastic garbage bags, believe not, wrestlers used this,
put sweats go running. That'll get warm. Again, careful not
overheat can get cold shower. lot ways, depending
budget access to. don't use cryo, cryotherapy
chambers, hard find. expensive. Again, use sauna ice bath


will anywhere three five rounds, lot, anywhere three five
rounds heat 20 minutes cold 5 minutes. cold
cold be? covered episode deliberate cold exposure. general
rule thumb. cold enough really want get out, not cold
unsafe. will vary person person. cannot give simple

accelerate recovery clear cardiovascular benefits,
maybe even benefits brain related cardiovascular benefits
course brain needs lot blood flow needs lot nutrients things

Heat can help accelerate improve that. improve
cardiovascular function, improve brain health, cold contrast provides sort
accelerator amplifier think better way phrase process
cold get vasoconstriction heat get vasodilation.
maximizing process, actually neural process. Nerves
actually innervate blood vessels capillaries even arteries order
allow constriction dilation process occur. Tuesday really
recovery, recovery day isn't necessarily just laying around not
anything. might still also take walks day. Remember, want try get
200 minutes zone two cardio across week, sometimes, not often,
sometimes get minutes walking quickly day. generally
working lot Tuesday Monday, little bit tired maybe even
little bit sore leg workout previous day Monday. try get hot cold

easily without even signing just want access straight off. Tuesday
really recovery getting additional cardiovascular benefits
heat cold contrast. One thing built rationale lot heat
cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold
contrast, hey, listen, somebody doesn't access sauna
don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

leg workout can intense large muscle groups,
explain off days, not pure off days, actually include
recovery type training even training. training legs
Monday, able get consider hardest strength hypertrophy workout
way, and, again, set positive physiological effects motion
entire week. thing no workout exists isolation. one day
going determined previous day. even though
previous day may taken three hour weight vested hike, never legs
sore long slow endurance work, long slow, unable
train legs. Contrast a, say, high intensity interval training workout, comes
later week, legs might sore. fact, might not even recovered
able real legwork, want say real workout. describe
means moment. legs come Monday, think
using interested using resistance training, suggest getting leg workout
done early week. heard phrase, don't skip leg
day, will go step say, don't skip leg day, fact, make leg day first
day strength

00:38:09 Key Principles Resistance Training

hypertrophy training. Put Monday. Okay, now talking
resistance training, question going come sets reps
business. covered lot detail podcast Dr. Andy Galpin,
going get detail now, going wait describe
entire set workouts week go even detail,
way called periodizing changing sets reps, et cetera, across
week, indeed month month, really optimal. don't want make
seem just pertains leg workout. actually pertains
resistance training. just give couple teasers key principles
resistance training think almost universally, not universally, generally
accepted strength training physiology community. later get back
overarching principles apply strength hypertrophy workouts
across week, including ones torso, arms, et cetera. Okay, legs fall
Monday, say leg workouts, like resistance training workouts, me,


consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

accelerate recovery leg workout previously. Also, listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate heat exposure listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate cold exposure, talk
benefits heat cold, get lot details can
access heat. can baths, can saunas, can even take hot showers.
don't access that, even wrap body neck
garbage bag, plastic garbage bags, believe not, wrestlers used this,
put sweats go running. That'll get warm. Again, careful not
overheat can get cold shower. lot ways, depending
budget access to. don't use cryo, cryotherapy
chambers, hard find. expensive. Again, use sauna ice bath


will anywhere three five rounds, lot, anywhere three five

Heat can help accelerate improve that. improve
cardiovascular function, improve brain health, cold contrast provides sort

recovery, recovery day isn't necessarily just laying around not
anything. might still also take walks day. Remember, want try get
200 minutes zone two cardio across week, sometimes, not often,
sometimes get minutes walking quickly day. generally
working lot Tuesday Monday, little bit tired maybe even
little bit sore leg workout previous day Monday. try get hot cold

really recovery getting additional cardiovascular benefits
heat cold contrast. One thing built rationale lot heat
cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean

consist about, again, not neurotically attached this, 10 minutes
warming 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work. Now, course,
going rest sets, real work, mean really hard work,
not necessarily failure, talk failure little bit, hard work
struggling complete final repetitions, not going failure continue move
weight repetitions. again, entire work portion workout 50 60
minutes. Why? Well, past 60 minutes, start getting increases cortisol really
impede recovery. personally somebody not recover well
high intensity exercise. realize within literature, believed, think
generally accepted, stimulate muscle hypertrophy strength increases,
impacts nervous system, also causes things like protein synthesis, et cetera.
number different forms adaptation occur give muscle strength
size changes. days people talk lot needing stimulate muscle
growth muscle strength least every 48 hours. can tell recover route
slowly, benefit working muscle group twice per week,
longer, say days rest workouts. train
legs Monday, believe not, training legs Monday. not
second leg workout week. However, Friday, high intensity interval
training session serves two purposes. One serves purpose triggering
certain type endurance getting heart rate very, high. addition
that, way workout, acts sort supplement
moderate intensity workout quadriceps, hamstrings, calves, least
never lose strength, fact, generally build strength one leg workout
next, provided things correctly. not referring kind
classic super high intensity training per week not actually training
muscle group again. me, really training muscle group twice per week,
directly indirectly, either another weight training workout
cardiovascular, say endurance training workout. again, legs Monday,
workout 50 60 minutes, brief warmup. generally pick two exercises per
muscle group. again, calves, quadriceps,
hamstrings. pick exercises work you. actually
not going share exercises use. give couple suggestions
ones use, really, exercise selection, Dr. Andy Galpin pointed out,
important variable. key thing emphasize variable need


able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday
no endurance, no resistance training day, doesn't mean not
anything overall health fitness. Tuesdays, series heat cold

cold contrast. really day two things. First all, trying
accelerate recovery leg workout previously. Also, listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate heat exposure listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate cold exposure, talk
benefits heat cold, get lot details can
access heat. can baths, can saunas, can even take hot showers.
don't access that, even wrap body neck
garbage bag, plastic garbage bags, believe not, wrestlers used this,
put sweats go running. That'll get warm. Again, careful not
overheat can get cold shower. lot ways, depending
budget access to. don't use cryo, cryotherapy
chambers, hard find. expensive. Again, use sauna ice bath


will anywhere three five rounds, lot, anywhere three five
rounds heat 20 minutes cold 5 minutes. cold
cold be? covered episode deliberate cold exposure. general

Heat can help accelerate improve that. improve
cardiovascular function, improve brain health, cold contrast provides sort
accelerator amplifier think better way phrase process

actually innervate blood vessels capillaries even arteries order
allow constriction dilation process occur. Tuesday really
recovery, recovery day isn't necessarily just laying around not
anything. might still also take walks day. Remember, want try get
200 minutes zone two cardio across week, sometimes, not often,
sometimes get minutes walking quickly day. generally
working lot Tuesday Monday, little bit tired maybe even
little bit sore leg workout previous day Monday. try get hot cold

really recovery getting additional cardiovascular benefits
heat cold contrast. One thing built rationale lot heat
cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold
contrast, hey, listen, somebody doesn't access sauna
don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes

mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

able perform movement safely. know huge debate there,
people love argue whether not one can squat deadlift long periods
time, not. people say absolutely should. personally
not squat not deadlift. actually never done much squatting deadlifting,
know people probably rolling eyes switching channel
point. can say me, able achieve strength
hypertrophy goals seeking, things like leg extensions hack
squats hamstrings, things like leg curls glute-ham raises calves
standing seated calf raises on. think key principle everyone
pay attention one taught excellent strength coach
years ago, still use least works me. muscle group, try
find exercise get muscle weighted stretch position.
be, instance, standing calf raise, bottom, weighted
deep stretch provided movement correctly. well
another exercise getting contraction shortened position
muscle. hamstrings, leg curl, calves,
seated calf raise, quadriceps, leg extension is, machine designed
right correctly, peak contraction largely going occur
legs extended position, another exercise muscle group puts
muscle stretched least larger range motion compound type
movement, ideally stretch there. guess will tell
exercise do, quadriceps going leg extensions hack squats. use
hack squats don't free bar squats safety reasons, like hack
squat machine. leg curls glute-ham raises hamstrings, standing
calf raises seated calf raises calves. Again, movements
use can perform safely repetition ranges weights
required either maintain build leg strength calf strength.
might decide you, dead lifts absolutely essential terrific, squats free
bar squats absolutely terrific front squats. not tell exercises
not do. telling probably wise least consider least
two exercises per muscle group, probably three maximum, ask
entire legs calves one day. think one exercise
muscle's brought shortened peak contraction position, like leg curls leg
extensions seated calf raise, another exercise muscle group


elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,

seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance

somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.

NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

elongation maybe even stretch muscle group. fact,
principle hear talk later talk training
muscle groups strength hypertrophy. now know approximately long
train, might somebody can get away training hour half,
won't impede recovery. me, really starts impede recovery.
Also, staying task, 60 minute limit really works well me. occasionally
train 75 minutes? Yes, waiting piece equipment, sometimes
just wait longer. happens. really try keep total duration
workout shorter. many sets reps rest intervals? Well, covered
Dr. Andy Galpin well. Without getting total science, brief summary
structure that. pretty clear going lower repetitions
heavier weight, going want bit volume. know spits
face lot people think, going five sets five,
consider five repetitions low repetition range, heavier weight, going
train higher repetitions, can fewer sets. certainly works me.
generally follow program month, three four weeks, will
resistance training repetition range four eight repetitions.
rather heavy. sets. might anywhere three four sets per
exercise. Again, still just two exercises. longer rest sets, anywhere
two minutes maybe even four minutes really heavy leg work.
next month, switch repetition range closer 8 12, maybe even 15 repetitions
per set, fewer sets overall, maybe just two three sets per exercise. Again,
just two exercises per muscle group typically. shorten rest sets
90 second, maybe even short 60 second rest sets,
typically 90 seconds two minutes two half minutes. basically one
month heavier, next month, slightly lighter, although wouldn't say lighter,
say moderate weight moderate rep range. tends work well me. also
adheres principal came discussion, again, Dr. Andy Galpin,
hypertrophy, really can use repetition ranges anywhere 5 30, three
zero, reps. emphasized changing repetition ranges order offset
boredom. Frankly, like train heavier. enjoy training four eight rep range.
However, notice four weeks row don't switch
training 8 12, maybe 15 repetition range month, well
can't make continuous progress. start actually lose ground. switching back


forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday
no endurance, no resistance training day, doesn't mean not
anything overall health fitness. Tuesdays, series heat cold
contrast. words, get really, really warm get really, really cold, get
really, really warm get really, really cold repeatedly. way
getting hot sauna. me, really hot, built heat
conditioning, please don't unless built ability withstand heat.
get 20 minutes. Sometimes 15, usually 20 minutes. get
will get ice bath cold water bath 45 50 degrees
Fahrenheit. Again, don't get water cold go shock. explain
good cold stimulus determine that. don't
access sauna ice bath, can traveling will take hot bath
alternate cold shower, hot bath, cold shower. hard hot bath ice
bath unless two baths. don't know hotel rooms, least never stayed
one two baths, although sure there. me, heat
cold contrast. really day two things. First all, trying
accelerate recovery leg workout previously. Also, listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate heat exposure listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate cold exposure, talk
benefits heat cold, get lot details can
access heat. can baths, can saunas, can even take hot showers.
don't access that, even wrap body neck
garbage bag, plastic garbage bags, believe not, wrestlers used this,
put sweats go running. That'll get warm. Again, careful not
overheat can get cold shower. lot ways, depending
budget access to. don't use cryo, cryotherapy
chambers, hard find. expensive. Again, use sauna ice bath


will anywhere three five rounds, lot, anywhere three five
rounds heat 20 minutes cold 5 minutes. cold
cold be? covered episode deliberate cold exposure. general
rule thumb. cold enough really want get out, not cold
unsafe. will vary person person. cannot give simple
prescriptive there. thing heat, hot enough sweating
want get out, not hot running risk injuring
killing yourself. again, will vary person person. build
slowly, careful build empirically. Tuesdays way
accelerate recovery clear cardiovascular benefits,
maybe even benefits brain related cardiovascular benefits
course brain needs lot blood flow needs lot nutrients things
flowing there, debris nutrients things brain.
Heat can help accelerate improve that. improve
cardiovascular function, improve brain health, cold contrast provides sort
accelerator amplifier think better way phrase process
cold get vasoconstriction heat get vasodilation.
maximizing process, actually neural process. Nerves
actually innervate blood vessels capillaries even arteries order
allow constriction dilation process occur. Tuesday really
recovery, recovery day isn't necessarily just laying around not
anything. might still also take walks day. Remember, want try get
200 minutes zone two cardio across week, sometimes, not often,
sometimes get minutes walking quickly day. generally
working lot Tuesday Monday, little bit tired maybe even
little bit sore leg workout previous day Monday. try get hot cold
contrast. benefits hot cold contrast. description
different protocols hot cold contrast Huberman Lab

easily without even signing just want access straight off. Tuesday
really recovery getting additional cardiovascular benefits
heat cold contrast. One thing built rationale lot heat
cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold
contrast, hey, listen, somebody doesn't access sauna
don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

forth, actually can make continuous progress least across year. hope
principle, say protocol communicated clearly. works
well, assure you. mean never get 10 repetitions week
supposed train four eight repetition range? No. Occasionally venture
10 repetition range, really try cluster low repetition work
month, again, across workouts exercises slightly higher, even
say moderate repetition work across next month. One thing notice since
talking total fitness programming months
moderate repetitions, notice endurance work will actually
facilitated. not think coincidence. fact, not coincidence.
training heavy heavier range, lower repetitions, et
cetera, tapping different processes muscles. head
long Sunday hike, soon hear, whereas Friday going
high intensity interval training, notice certain months weight
training, training heavy, workouts will feel, literally will feel
different will months moderate repetition work.
not competitive athlete. not running races triathlons like friends.
impressed them. really just trying get overall cardiovascular fitness,
overall strength, overall hypertrophy need it, maintain muscle size, et cetera,
muscle groups just trying maintain. really goal. not trying
optimize workouts one performance feature, little bit,
talk can change various aspects, is, variables protocols,
order say,

00:49:57 Day 3: Heat & Cold Exposure, Recovery

instance, really emphasize hypertrophy really emphasize endurance. Okay,
call standard endurance workout done Sunday, say
standard people, hear endurance, think ability
endure, continue repeated movement exercise period time,
workout done Sunday, leg workout done Monday, can
feel really good heading week. However, training legs
Monday, experience cardiovascular workouts next day either inefficient
least doesn't really allow completely recover leg workout. Now,


realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday
no endurance, no resistance training day, doesn't mean not
anything overall health fitness. Tuesdays, series heat cold

cold contrast. really day two things. First all, trying
accelerate recovery leg workout previously. Also, listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate heat exposure listen
episode Huberman Lab podcast deliberate cold exposure, talk
benefits heat cold, get lot details can
access heat. can baths, can saunas, can even take hot showers.
don't access that, even wrap body neck
garbage bag, plastic garbage bags, believe not, wrestlers used this,
put sweats go running. That'll get warm. Again, careful not
overheat can get cold shower. lot ways, depending
budget access to. don't use cryo, cryotherapy
chambers, hard find. expensive. Again, use sauna ice bath


will anywhere three five rounds, lot, anywhere three five
rounds heat 20 minutes cold 5 minutes. cold
cold be? covered episode deliberate cold exposure. general
rule thumb. cold enough really want get out, not cold
unsafe. will vary person person. cannot give simple
prescriptive there. thing heat, hot enough sweating
want get out, not hot running risk injuring
killing yourself. again, will vary person person. build
slowly, careful build empirically. Tuesdays way
accelerate recovery clear cardiovascular benefits,
maybe even benefits brain related cardiovascular benefits
course brain needs lot blood flow needs lot nutrients things
flowing there, debris nutrients things brain.
Heat can help accelerate improve that. improve
cardiovascular function, improve brain health, cold contrast provides sort

maximizing process, actually neural process. Nerves
actually innervate blood vessels capillaries even arteries order
allow constriction dilation process occur. Tuesday really
recovery, recovery day isn't necessarily just laying around not
anything. might still also take walks day. Remember, want try get
200 minutes zone two cardio across week, sometimes, not often,
sometimes get minutes walking quickly day. generally

sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean

realize people going immediately scoff that, fact,
really beautiful papers talking one can actually fair amount
cardiovascular exercise without interfering strength speed hypertrophy
improvements vice versa. fact, terrific review mentioned
podcast Dr. Andy Galpin. review provide citation to,
reference link to, review Murach Bagley, talks
whether not interference strength endurance workouts. Really
interesting review want peruse that. said, like take Tuesday

heat cold contrast. One thing built rationale lot heat
cold one day opposed every day... Well, addition


little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold
contrast, hey, listen, somebody doesn't access sauna
don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth

massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body

nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold
contrast, hey, listen, somebody doesn't access sauna
don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause

really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

little bit convenient certainly people don't access heat cold
sauna cold dunks et cetera every day. maybe getting one day
accessible feasible. addition that, clear benefits
sauna often, talked deliberate heat episode
episode Dr. Rhonda Patrick guest podcast, also clear
sauna seldom, week, lot one day,
case, hour, it's, remember, one more, three five rounds 20
minutes sauna followed 5 minutes cold so, one day,
peer reviewed research covered episode deliberate heat,
study Finland, showed get massive, even 16 fold increases growth
hormone, extremely beneficial metabolism recovery.
massive increases growth hormone seen sessions
sauna repeated day week.
Whereas sauna often, certainly benefits that, time
consuming need access sauna often one day week
one day week. one day week lot
sessions within day, detailed here, see massive increases
growth hormone not observed sauna often
benefits sauna. Now effects cold many, not just vasoconstriction,
effects cold also counterbalanced problems deliberate cold
exposure maybe heard podcast lot podcasts
seem kind buzz theme Twitter elsewhere. point this,
number quality studies showing deliberate cold exposure,
particular ice baths getting cold water immediately endurance
training session strength hypertrophy session, can indeed, yes, can disrupt
prevent adaptations seeking strength hypertrophy
endurance workouts. Okay, heard right. believe true
based now several quality peer-reviewed studies. deliberate cold
exposure Tuesday, not going get effects, blocking
hypertrophy blocking strength improvement blocking prevention
improvements endurance occur immediately got ice bath
hypertrophy strength endurance workout. Now caveat
somebody likes cold showers, not aware data says cold
showers cannot performed strength hypertrophy endurance workout. Cold


showers different submersion neck ice bath another cold body
water number different reasons. fact, tap different aspects
nervous system entirely. don't time go now, covered
episode deliberate cold exposure, simple point heat cold
contrast, hey, listen, somebody doesn't access sauna
don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy

nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

don't like hot baths just deliberate cold exposure Tuesday,
separate strength hypertrophy

00:59:22 Day 4: Torso & Neck Resistance Training

endurance workouts will not impede benefits workouts.
Okay, long endurance Sunday, leg resistance training Monday
Tuesday, heat cold contrast. brings us Wednesday. Wednesday get
back resistance training workout. resistance training workout
emphasize Wednesday one train torso. Yes, literally torso.
know counter so-called bro science bro splits. don't know
originated term, terrible term. essentially alienates anyone not bro
considers bro. case, not training chest back
shoulders. fact, really strengthening muscles torso course
includes chest shoulders back. sure, say this, number
people obsessed hypertrophy muscle growth filling
shirts whatever may be, thinking, oh no, just kind around
fitness. no, point is, Wednesday train torso going
involve pushing, that's, might include training things like
bench presses incline presses well shoulder presses lateral raises, things
shoulders well back, pulling exercises. bent
rows chin-ups pull-ups. Again, enormous number exercise
every one muscle groups. Now, believe clear benefit training
muscle groups together day, much way
training legs one day can lead systemic effects large
muscle groups, working pushing muscles pulling muscles torso
one day, least context program, time efficient, tends
wick number different dimensions health least interested
think lot people interested in. those? Well, think again,


want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent

want strong not just legs, upper body. also may want, may want
engage hypertrophy, grow certain muscle groups order create sense
balance. aesthetic reasons, also balancing strength health
of, integrity joints, et cetera. addition that, training bunch
different muscle groups together, opportunity get systemic
hormonal effects metabolic effects occur not just training one
muscle group isolating one muscle group, rather training bunch muscle
groups together. Wednesday train torso push pull fashion just
kind time efficiency. Sometimes means pushing exercise
pulling exercise. Sometimes might even mean set pushing set
pulling going back forth. However, gym, particular, crowded
gym, please don't one people colonizes multiple pieces equipment
says, working there, working there, can quite dance can
hard orchestrate workout like that. sometimes will starting off set
shoulder presses sets moving chin
ups moving perhaps back shoulders realizing, ah, oh, someone's
machine wanted, using equipment wanted, just finish
pulling, finish back work go push. don't obsess
alternation kind strict way. really just try get muscles torso
trained. again, two exercises per muscle group. one exercises
going something there's, realize isn't physiologically accurate,
shortening muscle they, end movement, muscle
maximal contraction. throw names exercises just purpose
understanding. like cable crossovers chest, peak contraction
end, whereas something like incline press, stretch provided
done full range motion beginning movement. again,
something stretch something peak contraction.
shoulders, little bit harder do, although ways that. Jeff
Cavaliere excellent workouts available, zero cost, YouTube. also
excellent programs athleanx.com site. certainly lot excellent protocols
YouTube Instagram. YouTube can put name
muscle group want train. terrific videos describing exercise
choice features exercise parameters. Again, peak contraction
shortening muscle, peak contraction exercise stretching exercise.


back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy
muscles maintain strength hypertrophy muscles, kind
nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.
anywhere three five sets lower repetition range, four eight
repetitions, going heavier weights longer rest described earlier,
rest intervals. next month going moderate repetitions,
fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

back, one might say, okay, seated row bent row dumbbell row
elbow brought behind torso peak contraction movement.
stretching movement might something like chin pull-up.
say this, understand stretching peak contraction aren't exact terms
one use physiotherapist strength conditioning coach,
think typical person trying generate strength hypertrophy

nomenclature way describing least clear even efficient. just
remind you, leg workout, total duration torso workout going
50 60 minutes brief warmup. sets repetitions going dictated
way described earlier. month going sets.

fewer sets, way described earlier. want details that,
can find newsletter related optimal foundational fitness protocol
can access hubermanlab.com. One thing note Wednesday
torso workout big believer training the, believe highly
avoided, least overlooked vitally important aspect total body stability, strength
safety, really, safety, neck. Now realize lot people don't want
large neck, totally understand aesthetic reasons don't want that.
kind interesting actually, think it, people large neck
often told no neck. People say guy no neck no neck
fact referring fact large neck. don't know
came be. Somebody put comments is, come
people big neck refer no neck. train neck? train
neck couple reasons. One years ago accent actually fell off
roof training neck time sport involved
walked away sore neck not broken neck. thought, wow,
really great training neck. addition that, car
accident parked... just bought car, first new car purchased,
parked car mother, grandfather backseat red light
someone rammed us full speed. Now fortunately, none us hurt.
rattled. again, sore back neck. think one


reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

reasons able essentially walk away that, didn't
sustained damage trained neck, started training neck
sport continue train neck notice don't train neck start
getting shoulder issues. talk excellent physiologist like Dr. Kelly Starrett
Ready State, excellent channel, can find social media
standard channels talk anyone really understands
strength torso upper body even back. learn that,
course, upper portion spine, stabilizing neck important.
Now, training neck can little bit detailed specific even dangerous
wrong. Again, Jeff Cavaliere terrific set videos training neck
properly. know lot people might think neck bridges used neck
bridges. occasionally still sneak neck bridge there, although don't
recommend discussions Jeff, will tell you, true,
discs eventually go can run serious issues bridges doesn't
happen gradually can't notice happening. just happens suddenly. might
occasionally neck bridge, general train neck wrapping plate towel
don't end imprint weight value head face.
moving neck side side front back, again, provide link
videos. terrific set videos describe train neck properly
safely. even not trying grow neck, definitely want make sure
use light weights make sure neck stable upright.
say stable upright clear reasons related texting
staring computers related weak neck relative rest muscles
stabilize spine, lot people, default stance default posture
chin forward not good. Not aesthetically not good, also can
create sorts issues related back pain headaches things sort.
real thing, training neck allows stand upright, sit upright. even believe
allows things like public speaking conversations people

01:08:40 Day 5: Moderate Intensity Cardiovascular Training, Running Alternatives

street way front facing opposed looking down.
Wednesday torso neck comes Thursday means another
cardiovascular exercise session, although brief one. Unlike endurance training


Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

Sunday, cardiovascular session Thursday, again, falls
Thursday, fall different day depending started
protocol, going about, again, 35 minutes of, me, running, although
rowing cycling, something sort. goal
workout important. goal workout tap into, remember long
list talked earlier got skill speed power strength
hypertrophy, et cetera, different forms endurance, get range
endurance heart rate elevated quite bit zone two,
not really going sprint. means warming
5 10 minutes. jogging, little bit light calisthenics, might even
hopping stationary bike, although honest loathe stationary bike,
setting timer 30, ideally 35 minutes call 75% 80%
out. Okay, now realize spits face heart rate monitor wearing super
techy exercise types. think sprint, think 100%. that?
mind somebody chasing needle full poison sprinting
away maximal speed. 100%. brief warm up, going
go out, typically outside, although sometimes treadmill
traveling, move, run 30 35 minutes 75% 80% out.
means striving keep steady pace, reality don't.
sometimes stop stoplight, cars, please don't run traffic just
maintain speed timing, terribly antagonistic fitness,
particular, lifespan. running tends running breathing hard
not able restrict purely nasal breathing. mentioned earlier,
Sunday long ruck weighted hike jog, alone, try pure nasal
breathing. people talking, obviously not going pure nasal
breathing talking, although sure sometimes wish
pure nasal breathing. Thursday workout accomplishes number things. First
all, really gets heart rate improves multiple aspects endurance,
recall earlier, different bins endurance include muscular
endurance, anaerobic, 3 12 minute range 30 minutes longer, none
really precisely match accomplished 35 minute cardiovascular
session pushing hard not out. exactly reason it,
taps multiple fuel systems muscle multiple aspects
heart capillaries arteries veins involved generating


movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

movement. really cuts broad swath multiple categories endurance.
also just keep mind foundational optimal fitness protocol really designed
do. mind, foundational fitness protocol one leaves
state need walk really far carry bunch weight, can it.
need lift heavy object legs, can it. need run really fast
two minutes, can it. need run little bit further, like maybe 10
minutes whatever reason, can that. really kind around fitness
program 35 minute run, again, swapped 35 minute erg row.
sometimes access stationary bike, that. suppose
didn't access equipment running not thing, one thing
done, especially stuck hotel 'cause arrived late someplace
really want get workout in, dreaded burpee. know
lot opinions there, people think burpees downright dangerous,
people love burpees. that. really fast full jumping
jacks. know little PE class, right? Physical education class-ish. sometimes
need get workout in, hotel arrived late particular day
travel will find stairwell, fire stairwell, make sure way can get
back building 'cause locked stairwells before. will simply
walk really fast stairwell many flights stairs are, maybe even jog
it, not quite sprint, run stairs order get
35 minutes 75% 80% max output cardiovascular work done. really
just restricted hotel room, just jumping jacks 30, 35 minutes, sometimes
watching something TV. believe me, full jumping jacks, like
really extending legs, really getting arms overhead really full
movement, time hit five six minutes going sweating
heart rate really going up. also sometimes will travel jump rope. always
try travel jump rope skip rope, much dismay people
housed hotel room. Skipping rope, mention, can
effective way getting cardiovascular training road.
seriousness, hotel room apartment can't really jump high
good jumping rope, find not going get
higher elevated heart rate zone. Okay? can great zone two type training,
really good skipping rope, wouldn't say really good it, done
enough skipping rope can just kind cruise talk it, zone twoish,


even feels like walking times. Now can double unders really
jumping putting rope twice time crossovers, et cetera,
depending skill level. again, apartment hotel,
going harder do. skill involved, sometimes
stopping often continuing. way, just
mention this, really terrific Instagram channel @anna.skips. teacher,
science teacher, believe math, maths say UK 'cause
UK, maths teacher. don't know Anna, know skips 'cause amazing
Instagram channel called Anna Skips. really cool Instagram
shows progression not able skip rope absolutely
incredible types rope skipping morning getting sunlight,
course essential health protocol. check Anna Skips Instagram,
really inspiring

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:15:28 Day 6: High-Intensity Interval Training, Maximum Heart Rate

made want get better skipping rope. still working it. Okay,
Thursday cardiovascular, call endurance, cardiovascular training workout
done, around roles Friday Friday going another cardiovascular training
session, alluded earlier, cardiovascular training session also
designed tap ability hard, say high intensity interval
training, tap strength hypertrophy increases legs. 'Cause remember,
train legs Monday science tells us protein synthesis
muscle group can stimulated every 42 72 hours. Tuesday
off, Wednesday off Thursday off don't want lose progress made
terrific Monday leg workout. order make sure can
things follow program pick back Monday another leg
workout, least recovery abilities work schedule, not going
entire leg workout going set whole thing whack.
is, won't able consistently workouts days
week. Now said, little bit later explain happens miss
workout can combine days, et cetera. really strive get certain
workouts done certain days consistently least best can. Friday high
intensity interval training, can take variety different forms. me, ideal


thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

thing do, me, again, something completely different. Exercise choice,
again, governed can safely don't injure
can perform effectively gets provides stimulus
want. trying Friday get heart rate way, way up. Talked
episode Dr. Andy Galpin. addition benefits getting 180-200
minutes zone two cardio per week, minimum, really good idea get
max near max heart rate least week. not going
long periods time. not going 30 minutes. can't sprint
30 minutes unless Steve Prefontaine. haven't seen movies "Without
Limits" "Prefontaine," absolutely see those. able go run
12 laps, seemed sprint close it. Incredible. people
not going going carried away stretcher try. high
intensity interval training ideally so-called assault bike Airdyne
bikes. bikes fan, might seem like, oh, just cools off,
actually lot resistance there. will typically 20 30 second
sprint using arms legs 10 seconds rest repeat sprint
20 30 seconds, 10 seconds rest, repeat. anywhere 8 12
rounds, which, trust me, even start little bit less, say not
intensity effort, time hit fifth sixth one, will certainly headed
not near maximum heart rate. Now maximum heart rate?
need heart rate monitor? No. like using sort thing, great. again, Andy
Galpin beautifully supplied us information. said take number 220
subtract age, people, most, going maximum
heart rate. Although certain people fit certain ages, not going
apply. little bit crude measure, good starting place can
look information see podcast episode, provide link
show note captions want get details that. don't use heart rate
monitor. trying get point quote unquote feel like want
die. Now don't want die, please don't die, right? not good
cardiovascular health, not just jump right fitness protocol. want get
point really feel like not pedal faster pull faster
assault bike, Airdyne bike, workout place time
choose not use bike rower, 'cause also use rower, will
simply sprint jog intervals. will sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds,


sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,

sprint 20 30 seconds, jog 10 seconds just repeat. used
big field next laboratory, old laboratory, used bring bulldog
Costello there. really good first sprint part just lie
watch. didn't even jog part. just go back forth, back
forth, back forth, panting like bulldog nonstop, barely able recover
sprinting again. basis workout several fold. First all, get
heart rate really high, towards maximum heart rate least week.
accomplish Friday. Also, sprinting jogging really
pushing hard assault bike Airdyne bike, using a, instance, skier
skier machine number different cardiovascular training tools, going
get activation legs, course not degree squats
dead lifts leg extensions leg curls. simply not case. going
trigger strength hypertrophy types adaptations muscle groups.
also represents second leg workout week not
touching weights. One important point don't think heard mentioned
anywhere else, hope Dr. Kelly Starrett podcast discuss
discussed one one, careful sprints
anything cardiovascular exercise, can get injured those. instance,
go just sprint across field, out, 20 30 seconds walk back
can again, don't surprised next day sciatica
even pelvic floor pain. don't recommend going movement
can't perform perfect form. Okay? me, really try stay away
sprints. sprint 95% can find go sprint,
don't know reason is, might extension limb something
like that, not sprinter, not sprinting coach. hope get Stu McMillan
Dan Pfaff, excellent sprinting coaches, point world
class sprinting coaches, not pro sprinter, not even amateur sprinter,
fitness sprinter. Airdyne assault bike rower really safer option
me. running sort movement unconstrained,
really, terms far stride is, mean obviously constrained
musculature, really careful not overextend something like that.
way not go out. again, goal Friday workout really
get heart rate high, high intensity interval training... number different ways
that. can look HIIT, HIIT workouts online, find one best


really pick something safe can consistently, believe
ideally will also trigger bit either strength hypertrophy speed power
maintenance even give little bit stimulus time roll around
leg workout on, again, Monday, got

01:22:56 Day 7: Arms, Neck & Calves Resistance Training

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill

little bit additional boost leg strength, hypertrophy, speed power.
covered Sunday Friday, Saturday rolls around Saturday
train arms, calves, neck. may sound training bunch
small muscle groups, biceps, triceps, necks calves, true,
mention also training torso second time indirectly,
sometimes not indirectly. say this? Well, keep mind, again,
strength hypertrophy, going every 48 72 hours,
want stimulate that, Wednesday train torso, right? Chest,
shoulders, back neck. Thursday rest, Friday rest. know lot
people going want emphasize body parts going think, oh,
train twice week. modest recovery ability low recovery
ability, do, cardiovascular training sessions, et
cetera, well then, Saturday will train arms, calves neck directly.
included that, remember, two exercises per muscle group, one peak
contraction, one somewhat stretch there. Included that, suggest
sort dip movement, think Pavel Tsatsouline said dip
synonymous least similar upper body squat. Excuse me, Pavel got
wrong. Maybe wasn't said that, big admirer work, certainly
dip great exercise hit multiple muscle groups, chest, shoulders, triceps,
maybe even back extent depending it.
dipping movement will indirectly stimulate strength hypertrophy, et cetera, chest
shoulders including sort pulling movement bicep, like chin
palms facing movement, pulling bar, especially close grip type
movement. even wide grip type movement, will course trigger strength
hypertrophy, maintenance improvements biceps, will also trigger strength
hypertrophy lats back. Okay, Saturday arm workout just
give example potential workout might exercises


maybe not just two, maybe three make sure get torso indirect stimulation.
look like? Well, might sort classic dumbbell curls
bicep maybe incline curl bicep stretch
incline bench, might finish two sets chin ups. palms facing you,
chin ups, three sets chin-ups depending whether not heavier load
month moderate weight month. Again, activating biceps muscles 'cause
arms day, also activating strength hypertrophy lats least maintaining
that, not training torso muscles Wednesday,
not allowing hypertrophy strength gains generated Wednesday
atrophy, disappear. Then, thinking triceps, might sort triceps
isolation peak contraction movement. tricep kickback
overhead extension stretch type movement kickback.
also regular old dips. might even start dips, again, going
activate torso muscles triceps. calf work way
Monday. neck work... Again, believer training neck multiple
times per week. able finish 45 50 minutes, great.
people will find lot small muscle groups, actually takes longer
go around exercises. again, just adhere
principles talked before, 50, five zero, 60 minutes real work
warmup asterisk next that, someone's equipment can't
find dumbbells need, et cetera, maybe 75 minutes max. really trying
not extend workout long, making sure activate arms directly,
also activating torso muscles indirectly, again, won't repeat time, again,
following weight repetition rest interval scheme talked
earlier, bit heavier, lower reps, sets longer rest month.
alternating repetitions yet fewer sets, right? Shorter rest intervals
month.

01:27:30 Flexibility Foundational Protocol, Workout Spacing

carries resistance training workouts regardless day
week. completed total arc across week can summarize
saying Sunday is, just say long endurance, Monday leg resistance training,
Tuesday, heat cold contrast, Wednesday, torso training plus neck, Thursday, call


moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean

sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean

moderate intensity cardiovascular exercise, 35 minute moderate intensity
cardiovascular exercise, Friday, high intensity interval training sprinting
variation thereof Saturday, arms, calves, neck torso, indirect work.
total structure. want emphasize again, not need start Sunday.
is, make long endurance work start Tuesday just fill
rest described before. really you. another important point want
make, neither anyone going successful exact
workouts exact days every week travel, work, illness,
demands, et cetera. thing schedule like much believe
will benefit well flexibility there. flexibility?
Well, say train typical Sunday workout endurance, train legs
Monday don't manage heat cold contrast Tuesday
whatever reason. Well, can put Wednesday. Just make sure going
cold stimulus, don't close, not within four, ideally eight hours
training torso, just heat skip
cold particular week, right? Not ideal, better not anything.
say, instance, leg workout particularly brutal, don't sleep well
Monday night Tuesday night. Well torso workout
Wednesday? Well, say, not move heat cold contrast Wednesday
push torso workout Thursday maybe also try 35 minute run
Thursday every rather lose total control program
let everything shuffle forward. basic principle. believe one
workouts, whether endurance resistance training, can shifted either
one day forward one day back, right? delay day
accelerate day order make sure get everything done across
week. fact, say best way think foundational fitness program
not details up, top down, big picture details,
say yourself, week going get long endurance in, another
day week, going make sure get kind moderate faster
endurance workout in, one day week, going get
sprint, high intensity cardiovascular exercise workout in. going get
three workouts somehow. addition that, will also resistance
training every muscle group body. means legs hard
least week, torso hard least week arms hard least


week. course also paying attention training calves.
do, reasons described before, believe want train neck least
keep strong. may not want generate hypertrophy there. People vary terms
quickly neck grows. people grows very, fast. people,
life them, can't get much hypertrophy neck. keeping neck strong,
least light work moderate weight work, very, important,
reasons stated earlier. set goals, specific days
workout isn't critical, specific spacing is. instance, not going
want high intensity interval training day train legs,
high intensity interval training correctly, going
taxing legs eating recovery. want space
two three days. think notice point really

01:31:49 Tool: Mind-Muscle Contraction, Physiological Sighs

optimize everything whole rather one specific aspect training
adaptation. Now said, realize people might hyper focused
things like strength hypertrophy aesthetics come it. key point
strength hypertrophy weight training, something
covered multiple podcasts, certainly one Jeff Cavaliere Dr. Andy
Galpin one building muscle strength hypertrophy, solo
episode. following, rare individual perfectly balanced
musculature, right? people can bit quad dominant hamstring dominant,
trouble activating glutes somebody terrible time trying activate
chest muscles, strong back, et cetera. clear
can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built
science say peer reviewed studies, done
lab, labs well, sets really strive
bring heart rate much possible, calm much possible,
so-called physiological sigh order that. two inhales
nose, back back, [sighs] long full exhale mouth. just
partially sake time, again. big deep inhale nose
sneak little bit second inhale maximally inflate lungs
alveoli lungs, full exhale air via mouth empty
lungs. fastest way aware calm nervous system down.
really, sets can use calm conserve
energy. move weight training set, really want ratchet
focus attention muscles going using. Now, like
acknowledge huge range parameters terms actually perform
set. can focus particular muscle try really isolate
beginning movement. people will really try isolate
peak contraction. people accentuate negative. speed cadence.
are, again, remember, concepts few, methods many.
interested various methods eccentrics concentrics different ways
changing cadence forth sets, enormous amount quality
information there, far much us get detail now. describe
general principles set mind, will, set,
focused muscles using moving weight. movement
weight important, can either focus moving weight challenging
muscles, right? can either try isolate muscles make specific muscles
work simply moving weight. Moving weight going geared
towards strength improvements, focusing muscle, called mind muscle link


going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen

evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.

can know not just based aesthetics, right, based deliberate contractibility
muscles. don't want get much detail sake time,
something peer reviewed research support also discussed
extensively Jeff Cavaliere guest. actually really
popularized notion absolutely true, can contract muscle
hard point almost feels like cramping, can even
no weight hand no resistance it, just
using mind muscle connection contract muscle hard isolate it, chances
able generate hypertrophy strength gains pretty easily muscle


compared muscles harder time activating. resistance
training, mind muscle link really important, much people will even
try emphasize contraction muscles sets, et cetera. personally,
not somebody likes mirror work out, not somebody
wants spend time sets flexing muscles et cetera whatever
reason, want actually rest sets, concerned performance
sets really putting mind muscle set, really try
emphasize deep relaxation sets. tool built

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols

going shift set toward hypertrophy. realize painting
broad brush here,

01:35:57 Safety & Endurance/Cardiovascular Workouts

nonetheless grounded way nervous system governs muscular
contraction. think people familiar number different
variables associated resistance training, sets, reps, rest intervals, cadence, et
cetera, also tremendous number important variables endurance
kind cardiovascular training. lot excellent resources
that. think important one, fact will go record saying believe
important variable endurance cardiovascular training
repetitive movement, able complete movement safely,
meaning not putting body range motion positions can
damage joints put kind compromised state. people might
think, well, seems kind silly. ever set the, instance, seat
high stationary bike done Airdyne assault bike type interval training
sprints, set high over-striding, were, next day, can really
pay price terms back pain sciatica. sometimes pain can
extend quite while. course don't want approach exercise
much caution neurotic preventive yet don't want approach
exercise way cavalier, forgive pun, Jeff, also going

01:37:18 Tool: Stress Poor Sleep & Workouts, Recovery & NSDR

compromise integrity joints musculature connective tissue. talk
real world practical variables. instance, say get poor
terrible night's sleep. train next day not? Well, really depends.
can honestly say best training sessions, resistance training
endurance training sessions really poor night's sleep. rare event.
often not, not sleeping well, terrible night's sleep, next day
will just skip training day. know will shock number there,
perhaps already calling names, weak, et cetera. find slept
really poorly stressful event day don't sleep well,


training next day sets getting ill getting ill sets not able
train multiple days. preference case skip day really
focus recovery. then, mentioned earlier, slide workout next day
rarely double workout another workout, just slide schedule
forward day. really try strive, is, really try double least
workouts later week case, can get back schedule starting
seven day protocol day. don't want excessively vague there.
trying say try adhere schedule, get poor night's
sleep, just simply skip workout next day, slide workout forward.
one exception that, important exception, times
not slept well particularly stressful event day haven't
slept well, able so-called NSDR, non-sleep deep rest next day.
times got three four hours sleep night
feeling really behind ball next morning, really want get workout in.
instead will 10, ideally case 30 even 60 minute non-sleep
deep rest. 10 minute non-sleep deep breath protocol read me.
non-spiritual, non-mystical, science-supported non-sleep deep breath protocol
available YouTube. can simply put name, Huberman, put NSDR,
Virtusan, V-I-R-T-U-S-A-N, YouTube find script.
NSDR scripts can find now Spotify YouTube. fall asleep
non-sleep deep rest scripts, great. don't, will also find
will restore ability perform mental physical work. times
haven't gotten much sleep like, feeling bit stressed
whatever reason,

01:40:04 Train Fasted Fed?

NSDR, will go train. often works fabulously well me.
don't skip workout entirely just didn't get good night's
sleep. lot people ask whether not train fasted fed,
controversial area. personally prefer cardiovascular work not eaten
anything previous 3 10 hours. typically wake
cardiovascular training within hour waking up, sometimes later,
first meal generally falls, generally, not always, falls around 11:00 AM. don't


kind formal intermittent fasting, typically meal schedule somewhere
11:00 a.m. last bite food around 8:00 p.m. not super strict that.
might eat late 9:00 p.m. might eat something 10:00 a.m. wake
really hungry, might something 11:00 a.m., not neurotic it.
terms training, like train fasted includes resistance training workouts
come early day me. typically going train legs
Monday, instance, train legs, make sure night
ingesting starch, carbohydrate, like rice pasta something sort
make sure morning leg workout, enough glycogen
muscles, et cetera. Again, nutrition somewhat controversial area. fact, can
evoke strong feelings 'cause know got vegans got omnivores
got carnivores people keto. isn't really format us get
that. think rule follow figure optimizes training
particular training goals. me, often means training fasted eating
pretty soon train. high intensity resistance training workout,
frankly, resistance training workouts pretty high intensity, not going
failure every set, least, say, 30% sets going failure.
sets working hard nonetheless, well eat starches
train also ingest protein form protein drink meal includes
protein food. don't like eat resistance training least not
within hour two resistance training. exceptions that,
say basically applies endurance work. going head
run, typically don't want belly full food food all, times
wake hungry much need eat something something
scheduled socially like breakfast breakfast hour 90
minutes later workout want make sure finish workout. I,
again, not neurotically attached training fasted fed.

01:42:43 Tool: Static Stretching & Flexibility, Irradiation & Resistance Training

me, fasted preferred, train fed, better train not train all.
haven't talked much flexibility yet, entire episode
Huberman Lab podcast flexibility encourage check episode
interested increasing flexibility. basic takeaway episode


look like call center mass research,
studies conclusions quality studies point to, not
exceptions, kind general rules gleaned time multiple
labs multiple decades, et cetera. find static stretching, is,
holding stretch fact exhaling relaxing midsection torso relaxing
stretch opposed staying full air tense, mentally physically
relaxing stretch, not stretching maximally, not extending far
possibly can go, like 60% even less. holding static stretches
anywhere 30 60 seconds repeating, two three times
throughout week multiple muscle groups, quadriceps,
hamstrings, lats. protocols there. fact,
newsletter focused entirely protocols flexibility stretching. can find
going hubermanlab.com. don't even need sign newsletter,
although invite like, can simply go there, scroll
flexibility newsletter protocols muscle groups, et
cetera. typically try stretching evening, train
morning, perhaps getting ready bed TV on,
house doesn't typically go don't TV, course
computers people computers, et cetera. Well, try
stretching that. also standing desk, day work,
regardless whether not train morning not, going train
afternoon, try static stretching hamstrings, quads, lats,
shoulders, back, really doesn't take much time really try space
throughout week, which, look peer reviewed research, matches well
known effective, going short, repeated sessions ideally
every day. truth told, fail. categorically fail. think whether not
ever stretch every day. fail every day, get three stretching
sessions per week. again, just static hold, trying really relax stretch.
Now relax stretch something talked martial arts circles
Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
movement, extensive near infinite landscape discussion, again,
don't time go into. just want mention two nervous system related
tips suppose neuroscientist, appeal grounded
fundamental principles nervous system innervates muscle.

01:47:56 Tool: Hanging Bar & Fitness Metric

know will benefit first time use every time.
Speaking grip nervous system fitness longevity, Dr. Peter Attia,
medical doctor, guest Huberman Lab podcast provided enormous
wealth information podcast episode. really encourage check
time. course spectacular podcast, Drive


Peter Attia. Peter, Dr. Attia, say, often talks certain movements
exercises perform not just improve fitness, also touch
measure fit well progressing toward long lifespan
healthspan. one includes ability hang bar minute
longer. number different expectations one can long
able hang bar depending age fitness level, et
cetera. Please check Dr. Attia's podcast various social media sites get
information that. can tell going hang bar
want hang bar long possible, turns
interesting

01:49:02 Train Sick?, Ramping Training

important metric health, gripping bar tightly will actually help.
Earlier talked whether not train sleep deprived
recover say moderate sleep deprivation NSDR opposed
total sleep deprivation like night truly miserable night,
case, think just skip training next day slide forward. Now, similar
issue comes time time people wonder whether not train
not sick. sorts crazy gym lore sport specific lore.
instance, used hear this, ran cross country, adage
symptoms neck up, still train. really
congested headache, still run. Whereas chest
lungs couldn't run. don't think data whatsoever support
whether not true whether not true. myself, general
goal training fit time, also include general health fitness
equation, not sick chronically sick certainly not get people
sick. little tiny sniffle, like think might getting sick, even then, little
cautious sense not going typical workout. might stop
15 minutes earlier. not neglecting body parts anything
sort. weight training workout, simply reducing total number sets,
probably wouldn't sets failure, did, might reduce total number
percentage sets failure 30% sets maybe closer 10% sets,
something like that. endurance work, might throttle back 10 20%.


will shorten total duration workout. often find
known, yes, peer reviewed known immune system enhancing effects exercise,
sometimes alone will allow avoid getting sick. course also careful
get home, take hot shower, not stress out, can avoid getting stressed
focus sleep, NSDR, forms recovery, good nutrition, et cetera.
however, real sniffle, cold, not feeling well think might coming
flu, absolutely not train don't get back training kind
completely recovered. basically saying that, no, don't believe
train sick. perhaps equally importantly, come back
layoff kind, whether not illness whatever reason, believe
body bit untrained, not ideal jump right back maximal
training take one, maybe two weeks ramping full duration
intensity workouts continue going however many cycles can
complete hit another sickness hit another gap schedule due family
obligations obligations, et cetera. covered lot tools protocols
variables related fitness,

01:52:19 Tool: Deliberate Slow Breathing & Recovery

no means covered available tools protocols variables.
wrap up, want emphasize one tool. easy, fact, zero cost,
low time commitment tool. one provided, again, Dr. Andy
Galpin Huberman Lab podcast. tool excellent
research support effectiveness of, believe come end
every training session. three five minutes deliberately slowed
breathing. sounds simple, three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing.
shower arrive car, might sit
car quietly time maybe even driving back to,
onto next destination, just really slow breathing, really look
recovery period follow training session. course,
adaptations, changes make fit going exercise
occur. three five minutes deliberately slowed breathing shown
Andy's group related experiments, not exactly same, related experiments
laboratory, laboratories, really so-called downshift nervous system


really set maximal recovery, rapid recovery, allow lean
next training session full intensity training session eventually arrives.

Pavel Tsatsouline excellent book stretching, can provide link that,
talks this, lot relaxation nervous system way
nerves innervate muscles allow stretch, will. Also, way
tendons ligaments innervated nerves. converse also true. here,
again, principle Pavel put forth, believe calls irradiation, meaning


irradiating emanating source, exhaling relaxing
torso, midsection, people call core, although people don't like
term, can facilitate relaxation stretching larger range motion.
can contracting core, midsection, gripping tightly fist can facilitate
muscular contraction way nervous system heavily, can even
say over-represents fists brain. apply
overall foundational fitness protocol? Well, turns that, say,
movement involves one limb moving other, say bicep curls, just
sake example, turns will actually stronger moving dumbbell
arm happens moving grip handle tightly, also grip
handle opposite dumbbell tightly. Now said, sets,
encourage opposite. try completely relax sets, combine
physiological sigh, set, next set commences, employ
strong grip, both, again, weight moving weight
moment might stationary isometric position. nervous system, course,
controls muscles operates directions. want relax, try
use long exhales, maybe even physiological sighs really concentrate mentally
physically relaxing, particular core fists. want generate
force, right, want move heavy barbell dumbbell, want chin
maximal force, can employ opposite, grip
bar dumbbell, et cetera, tightly. want contract core even fill
body air a, say, plug leaks, et cetera. gets kind form
