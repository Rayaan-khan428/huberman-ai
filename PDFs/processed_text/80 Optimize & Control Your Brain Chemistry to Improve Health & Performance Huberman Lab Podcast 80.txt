podcast, find information incredibly interesting
actionable. two studies going discuss relate sleep sleep
states access better sleep. first one published journal Cell
Reports, Cell Press journal, excellent journal. title paper "Rapid
Reversible Control Human Metabolism "by Individual Sleep States". will provide

basically measured different forms metabolism occur
humans sleep. far know, one first studies kind.
many studies metabolism. many studies sleep. study focused

found absolutely fascinating. First all, found sleep states regulate
50%, half metabolite features detected human breath.
mean? Well, turns can figure humans metabolizing
particular, lipids carbohydrate, whether not relying
glucose metabolism based contents breath. true waking
sleep. allowed incredible measurements
metabolized sleep. measured close 2000 metabolites
breath, every 10 seconds across entire night's sleep. found
major pathways related lipid metabolism, fat metabolism, carbohydrate

might say waking? Well, yes, also looked people fell asleep
emerged sleep. believe not every often sleep, wake up,
didn't know this, wake middle night, look around go
back sleep. not aware still rather sleep like state,
although awake. found sleep various states sleep
regulated individual metabolic pathways. found instance, switch
sleep wakefulness reduces fatty acid oxidation. means asleep,
oxidating fatty acids. wake up, becomes less case.
switch slow wave sleep increases fatty acid oxidation.

00:09:52 Tools: Wake Earlier, Night Owls

wakefulness. underscores need get sleep.
question get enough sleep make sure get
different sleep states. particularly important so-called night owls.
lot controversy whether not different so-called chronotypes
exist, people just naturally genetically want early bird, wake
early go bed early. people wake 4:00
comfortable going bed seven 8:00 PM 9:00 PM. called night
owls, people feel best tend feel best go sleep 1:00 AM,
2:00 AM, even 3:00 AM, like wake later 8:00, 9:00, 10:00, even 11:00
noon. course, people go sleep somewhere 10:00 PM
midnight wake somewhere 5:00 7:00 AM, suppose
typically 6:00 8:00 AM. Now whether not real chronotypes exist whether


not people simply select schedules sleep wakefulness like
social schedules activities enjoy. instance, people like really
go out, like go dancing hear music, spend time venues
open late night, don't even open noon after. people like
rarely go night like get early. like exercise. like see sunrise,
et cetera. don't know morning person evening person. just know
things enjoy tend happen early part day. things don't enjoy
quite much tend happen late night. Regardless whether not real
genetic propensities night owl early bird sort typical person right
middle, important people control sleep
schedule even important, people able get sufficient amount REM
sleep slow wave sleep, many reasons, including reasons discussed
previous study related metabolism. excited, therefore, study
came sleep medicine. years ago, somehow missed one.
published 2019. title article "Resetting Late Timing
'Night Owls' "Has Positive Impact Mental Health, "Physical Health

night owl, just going impossible very, challenging do. Turns
not impossible not even challenging provided right things.
Just brief overview study give key takeaways.

all, told participants try wake two three hours typical wake

minutes pre-designated time. waking seven o'clock one
day, set alarm made sure got bed seven o'clock every
day plus minus 30 minutes, never later 7:30, never earlier 6:30.
Participants also asked try go sleep two three hours
habitual bedtime. again, people want stay late, like 11:00 PM,
perhaps, even late 1:00 2:00 AM. now asked go

so-called food trained circadian clocks. eat, tells body alert
not eating, asleep. told not drink

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty

also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off

really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright
light exposure eyes hours 10:00 PM 4:00 another way
putting realize people sleep different times, et cetera, avoid
bright light exposure eyes, not just blue light, colors light phase three,
17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,

lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior

dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically

tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might

sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot

quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human

find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know

lot controversy whether not different so-called chronotypes
exist, people just naturally genetically want early bird, wake

comfortable going bed seven 8:00 PM 9:00 PM. called night
owls, people feel best tend feel best go sleep 1:00 AM,
2:00 AM, even 3:00 AM, like wake later 8:00, 9:00, 10:00, even 11:00
noon. course, people go sleep somewhere 10:00 PM
midnight wake somewhere 5:00 7:00 AM, suppose
typically 6:00 8:00 AM. Now whether not real chronotypes exist whether


not people simply select schedules sleep wakefulness like

phase three 24-hour cycle, 17 24-hour period, one
deeply asleep, whether not nocturnal diurnal, right? 17 hours
waking, asleep. lot episodes podcast.
indeed, today, started talking two particular studies related sleep,


lot tools enhance sleep, et cetera. course things can
late portion phase two day order enhance transition time

supplements. not breathing practices. things fall back asleep,
not really much sleep. mainly going focus
calling phase one phase two. Phase one, dopamine epinephrine
dominated phase day. phase two serotonergic serotonin
dominated portion day. might say, well, acetylcholine?
forgot acetylcholine? Well, didn't forget acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
control terms happen given moment,
whether not focusing not focusing, whether not learning not
learning. referring acetylcholine specifically context brain
thinking, probably shouting there, right,
exercise physiologist know anything brain controls movement,
acetylcholine used nerve muscle synapse, right? neurons don't just
control neurons electrically. way able move fact
neurons controlling electric activity muscles, literally contraction muscle

working muscles, well, not focused today. focused
can phase one day can phase two
day control specific neuromodulators, dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin,
acetylcholine, toward particular end goals. harping last five
10 minutes so, important understand early phase one part
day, again, zero nine hours, dopamine epinephrine already dominate
neuromodulator landscape. already elevated will taper off
phase two. Whereas phase two day, serotonin tends dominate
dopamine epinephrine. think that, means
goal increase serotonin order get particular effect mental

dopamine epinephrine serotonin happens so, will know
tool select hard need push tool, right? levels
dopamine already riding pretty high, early part day, well


doesn't take whole lot get dopamine level can, instance,
change level motivation. Whereas late part day, say
eight 9:00 PM, lot serotonin swimming around system
really need focused alert, well, can leveraging
dopamine epinephrine system indeed acetylcholine system too,
going resort tools can far potently can
much sustained way going access state want. again,
really important understand backdrop neuromodulators is,
so-called baseline vary across day going able

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change
circumference blood vessels arteries capillaries change way
blood flows. can change way see world, literally. change way
see world visual system. happens order
hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine
down, right? Dopamine up, prolactin down. general, way work.
take look neuromodulator systems functions
own, understanding never truly function own, can start
really make sense landscape tools available us tools
going powerful select goal instance, focused goal
less stressed goal highly motivated highly focused sake
learning. indeed possible understand four neuromodulators
understand many tools ranging pharmacologic
behavioral can tap neuromodulator systems, can kind press

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm
states. instance, somebody newborn child, know flooded

01:08:52 Tyrosine-rich Foods & Dopamine

way increase dopamine make sure baseline levels
dopamine high enough make sure eating sufficient numbers
tyrosine-rich foods. can look foods include tyrosine. Tyrosine


precursor dopamine. amino acid direct pathway dopamine synthesis
tyrosine foods include things like certain meats, Parmesan cheese, high

not. don't want go far off topic, cheese effect kind interesting
certain people will take antidepressants called MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Anytime hear ASE, enzyme. will take

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,

actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually

literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life

typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing

Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual

Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs

increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall

wakefulness. underscores need get sleep.
question get enough sleep make sure get
different sleep states. particularly important so-called night owls.
lot controversy whether not different so-called chronotypes
exist, people just naturally genetically want early bird, wake
early go bed early. people wake 4:00
comfortable going bed seven 8:00 PM 9:00 PM. called night
owls, people feel best tend feel best go sleep 1:00 AM,
2:00 AM, even 3:00 AM, like wake later 8:00, 9:00, 10:00, even 11:00
noon. course, people go sleep somewhere 10:00 PM
midnight wake somewhere 5:00 7:00 AM, suppose
typically 6:00 8:00 AM. Now whether not real chronotypes exist whether


not people simply select schedules sleep wakefulness like
social schedules activities enjoy. instance, people like really
go out, like go dancing hear music, spend time venues
open late night, don't even open noon after. people like
rarely go night like get early. like exercise. like see sunrise,
et cetera. don't know morning person evening person. just know
things enjoy tend happen early part day. things don't enjoy
quite much tend happen late night. Regardless whether not real
genetic propensities night owl early bird sort typical person right
middle, important people control sleep
schedule even important, people able get sufficient amount REM
sleep slow wave sleep, many reasons, including reasons discussed
previous study related metabolism. excited, therefore, study
came sleep medicine. years ago, somehow missed one.
published 2019. title article "Resetting Late Timing
'Night Owls' "Has Positive Impact Mental Health, "Physical Health

stay late sleep in, desire able get feel alert order
go work study want go sleep bit earlier. lot
questions embedded study particular, whether not people can actually shift
schedule hours more. people contend
night owl, just going impossible very, challenging do. Turns
not impossible not even challenging provided right things.
Just brief overview study give key takeaways.
randomized control trial. involved number different people, male female.
used non-pharmacological, practical interventions real
world setting, paraphrasing. used targeted light exposure. used
consistent sleep, wake times. used fixed meal times, caffeine intake exercise.
one reasons love study much done episodes
talked temperature, exercise, feeding, importantly, light
exposure way control shift sleep wake cycles, so-called circadian
timing entrainment. find? Well, found "Significant improvements
"in terms mood far less depression stress", subjectively measured, "as well
improved cognitive performance", objectively measured. improved reaction


times, improved physical grip strength, actually measure not just strength
per se, also nervous system function number things people
order optimize morning hours, even though night owls previously.
people do? Well, going just going list off sort rapid
fire succession. provide link study want learn more. First
all, told participants try wake two three hours typical wake
time, two three hours. seems brutal probably seems brutal
somebody typically wakes 10:00 try get eight even
7:00 consistently, also asked maximize outdoor light exposure
mornings reasons listened podcast before,
heard talk before, know, constantly talking about, probably go
grave shouting, please get much light exposure sunlight early day
possible sets motion huge number things beneficial
mental health physical health, including dopamine production, timing melatonin
production correctly, reducing cortisol peaks late day, et cetera, et cetera.
asked get lot outdoor light exposure. didn't give specific
amount. said, maximize outdoor light exposure mornings, time
noon. again, waking two three hours
habitual wake time. also told, important going
shift schedule earlier, try keep sleep wake times fixed work
days weekends. not sleeping weekends not sleep
days, regardless well slept night before. fixed? Within 15 30
minutes pre-designated time. waking seven o'clock one
day, set alarm made sure got bed seven o'clock every
day plus minus 30 minutes, never later 7:30, never earlier 6:30.
Participants also asked try go sleep two three hours
habitual bedtime. again, people want stay late, like 11:00 PM,
perhaps, even late 1:00 2:00 AM. now asked go
sleep two three hours habitual bedtime wake two three hours

asking here. asked participants keep regular
schedule daily meals, not eating hour consistently, know, 9:00 AM,
noon, 3:00 PM, exactly. within again, 15 30 minutes, always eating
times. also important. again,
so-called food trained circadian clocks. eat, tells body alert
not eating, asleep. told not drink
caffeine 3:00 PM afternoon. Another theme talked
podcast. also told not take naps 4:00 PM. Naps interesting
feature sleep wake cycle. brief pull episode
world sleep expert University California Berkeley, Matt Walker,

know lot PTs lot online, know, gym rats
people who, runners too, matter, will say, well according body
temperature research, best exercise afternoon. Look, better
exercise sometime opposed no time, focused shift
schedule earlier, meaning get earlier go sleep earlier, study people
exercise early part day, certainly 2:00 PM ideally noon.
again, really important study combines lot different variables

00:31:32 Neuromodulators Work

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,
diurnal, awake day, pretty much everybody follows schedule
zero nine hours waking, time wake nine
hours later, neuromodulators, dopamine epinephrine, tend highest
levels will point 24-hour period, period day.
can call zero nine hour period phase one day, just simplicity.
referred previous episode, not exact context. nine
16 hours call phase two. dopamine
epinephrine levels tend subside bit compared earlier phase one part
day serotonin levels start increase. phase three 24-hour cycle,
about, zero approximates, 17 hours
waking 24 hours waking phase three day. time,
chaos terms neuromodulators present brain.
chaos, mean sleep, incredible peaks acetylcholine
drops acetylcholine. incredible peaks dopamine drops dopamine.
incredible peaks serotonin drops serotonin. often, not
going see much release epinephrine, adrenaline,
epinephrine, also called adrenaline, tends wake us put us action mode
behaviors simply not happening sleep. three
neuromodulators, across night, sort chaos. got peaks drops

organized according specific reparative goals sleep, specific metabolic roles
sleep, et cetera. not going focus much phase three today
phase three 24-hour cycle, 17 24-hour period, one
deeply asleep, whether not nocturnal diurnal, right? 17 hours
waking, asleep. lot episodes podcast.
indeed, today, started talking two particular studies related sleep,


lot tools enhance sleep, et cetera. course things can
late portion phase two day order enhance transition time
depth sleep. can't really much sleep, right? not taking
supplements. not breathing practices. things fall back asleep,
not really much sleep. mainly going focus
calling phase one phase two. Phase one, dopamine epinephrine
dominated phase day. phase two serotonergic serotonin
dominated portion day. might say, well, acetylcholine?
forgot acetylcholine? Well, didn't forget acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
control terms happen given moment,
whether not focusing not focusing, whether not learning not
learning. referring acetylcholine specifically context brain
thinking, probably shouting there, right,
exercise physiologist know anything brain controls movement,
acetylcholine used nerve muscle synapse, right? neurons don't just
control neurons electrically. way able move fact
neurons controlling electric activity muscles, literally contraction muscle

day control specific neuromodulators, dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin,
acetylcholine, toward particular end goals. harping last five
10 minutes so, important understand early phase one part
day, again, zero nine hours, dopamine epinephrine already dominate
neuromodulator landscape. already elevated will taper off
phase two. Whereas phase two day, serotonin tends dominate
dopamine epinephrine. think that, means
goal increase serotonin order get particular effect mental

doesn't take whole lot get dopamine level can, instance,
change level motivation. Whereas late part day, say
eight 9:00 PM, lot serotonin swimming around system
really need focused alert, well, can leveraging
dopamine epinephrine system indeed acetylcholine system too,
going resort tools can far potently can

really important understand backdrop neuromodulators is,
so-called baseline vary across day going able

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change
circumference blood vessels arteries capillaries change way
blood flows. can change way see world, literally. change way
see world visual system. happens order
hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus

physiological responses "to immersion water different temperatures". not
going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases
dopamine. Many people will ask protocols follow. instance, will cold
shower suffice? likely, yes, shower gets cold enough. need ice

provided given safely gone safely, giving kinds increases
dopamine seek using prescription pharmacology. Now shouldn't
used replacement prescription pharmacology, although people done
success. One previous guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna
Lembke, director Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic Stanford.
amazing book called "Dopamine Nation", dopamine uses, healthy,
perils things like addiction. describes patient used
deliberate cold exposure try maintain dopamine levels coming off drugs
increasing dopamine potently putting path

lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day
motivation, mood focus. course, keep mind things can suppress
dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going

might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency

silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases

night owl, just going impossible very, challenging do. Turns
not impossible not even challenging provided right things.
Just brief overview study give key takeaways.

all, told participants try wake two three hours typical wake

minutes pre-designated time. waking seven o'clock one
day, set alarm made sure got bed seven o'clock every
day plus minus 30 minutes, never later 7:30, never earlier 6:30.
Participants also asked try go sleep two three hours
habitual bedtime. again, people want stay late, like 11:00 PM,
perhaps, even late 1:00 2:00 AM. now asked go

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,
diurnal, awake day, pretty much everybody follows schedule

pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously

ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair

Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off

really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least

people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,

going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various

mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,

mention hormones also important understanding background

paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously

incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off

really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least

people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort

going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen

testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,

levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body

serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed

feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,

increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.

Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap

certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources

find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going

resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-

find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background

paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty

Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,

toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,

Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap

still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going

never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer

resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,

30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.

00:31:32 Neuromodulators Work

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,
diurnal, awake day, pretty much everybody follows schedule
zero nine hours waking, time wake nine

forgot acetylcholine? Well, didn't forget acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
control terms happen given moment,
whether not focusing not focusing, whether not learning not

10 minutes so, important understand early phase one part

hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine
down, right? Dopamine up, prolactin down. general, way work.
take look neuromodulator systems functions
own, understanding never truly function own, can start
really make sense landscape tools available us tools
going powerful select goal instance, focused goal
less stressed goal highly motivated highly focused sake
learning. indeed possible understand four neuromodulators
understand many tools ranging pharmacologic

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life

typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual

acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase

Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs

increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.

prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back

never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.

00:31:32 Neuromodulators Work

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,

hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine
down, right? Dopamine up, prolactin down. general, way work.
take look neuromodulator systems functions
own, understanding never truly function own, can start
really make sense landscape tools available us tools
going powerful select goal instance, focused goal
less stressed goal highly motivated highly focused sake
learning. indeed possible understand four neuromodulators
understand many tools ranging pharmacologic
behavioral can tap neuromodulator systems, can kind press
gas dopamine, pull back serotonin on, particular tools,
behavioral supplementation-based, extent, prescription drug
based, too, touch those. understand work,
well, can create sort kit, grab bag things can use

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm
states. instance, somebody newborn child, know flooded

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,

high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience

see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,

Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap

still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going

resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,

dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.

00:31:32 Neuromodulators Work

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,
diurnal, awake day, pretty much everybody follows schedule
zero nine hours waking, time wake nine
hours later, neuromodulators, dopamine epinephrine, tend highest

not really much sleep. mainly going focus
calling phase one phase two. Phase one, dopamine epinephrine

dominated portion day. might say, well, acetylcholine?
forgot acetylcholine? Well, didn't forget acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
control terms happen given moment,
whether not focusing not focusing, whether not learning not

thinking, probably shouting there, right,
exercise physiologist know anything brain controls movement,
acetylcholine used nerve muscle synapse, right? neurons don't just

10 minutes so, important understand early phase one part
day, again, zero nine hours, dopamine epinephrine already dominate
neuromodulator landscape. already elevated will taper off
phase two. Whereas phase two day, serotonin tends dominate
dopamine epinephrine. think that, means
goal increase serotonin order get particular effect mental

dopamine already riding pretty high, early part day, well


doesn't take whole lot get dopamine level can, instance,
change level motivation. Whereas late part day, say
eight 9:00 PM, lot serotonin swimming around system
really need focused alert, well, can leveraging
dopamine epinephrine system indeed acetylcholine system too,
going resort tools can far potently can
much sustained way going access state want. again,
really important understand backdrop neuromodulators is,
so-called baseline vary across day going able

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context

get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-

excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel

day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine

Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much

300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk

terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively

acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase

Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs

increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.

prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going

never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various

mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change

hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen

serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall

00:31:32 Neuromodulators Work

times want. Just quickly. want talk neuromodulators
able work, regardless whether not dopamine serotonin epinephrine,
et cetera. many features neuromodulators work, sake today's
discussion, need focus two features. fast-acting
features longer slower features call baseline features. talking
say faster baseline? Well, consider given moment, whether


not asleep awake, whether not morning afternoon night,
amount dopamine released brain body, amount
serotonin, amount epinephrine amount acetylcholine. rarely,
ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved
states focus can actually open up, can literally create states mind
brain plastic able change learn quickly. Well, acetylcholine
can own, rarely own. typically, gets
assistance neuromodulators. Now might seem like
complicates picture, actually makes picture far simpler
can say sure fast actions dopamine fast actions epinephrine,
serotonin acetylcholine actions occur order seconds minutes
hour so. Whereas slower actions neuromodulators tend
occur order hours, days, even weeks.

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,
diurnal, awake day, pretty much everybody follows schedule
zero nine hours waking, time wake nine
hours later, neuromodulators, dopamine epinephrine, tend highest

indeed, today, started talking two particular studies related sleep,


lot tools enhance sleep, et cetera. course things can
late portion phase two day order enhance transition time
depth sleep. can't really much sleep, right? not taking
supplements. not breathing practices. things fall back asleep,
not really much sleep. mainly going focus
calling phase one phase two. Phase one, dopamine epinephrine
dominated phase day. phase two serotonergic serotonin
dominated portion day. might say, well, acetylcholine?
forgot acetylcholine? Well, didn't forget acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
control terms happen given moment,
whether not focusing not focusing, whether not learning not
learning. referring acetylcholine specifically context brain
thinking, probably shouting there, right,
exercise physiologist know anything brain controls movement,
acetylcholine used nerve muscle synapse, right? neurons don't just
control neurons electrically. way able move fact
neurons controlling electric activity muscles, literally contraction muscle

working muscles, well, not focused today. focused
can phase one day can phase two
day control specific neuromodulators, dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin,
acetylcholine, toward particular end goals. harping last five
10 minutes so, important understand early phase one part
day, again, zero nine hours, dopamine epinephrine already dominate
neuromodulator landscape. already elevated will taper off
phase two. Whereas phase two day, serotonin tends dominate
dopamine epinephrine. think that, means
goal increase serotonin order get particular effect mental
performance physical performance health, goal increase
dopamine epinephrine, get particular effect mental health, physical
performance, et cetera, well, need consider background level
dopamine epinephrine serotonin happens so, will know
tool select hard need push tool, right? levels
dopamine already riding pretty high, early part day, well


doesn't take whole lot get dopamine level can, instance,
change level motivation. Whereas late part day, say
eight 9:00 PM, lot serotonin swimming around system
really need focused alert, well, can leveraging
dopamine epinephrine system indeed acetylcholine system too,
going resort tools can far potently can
much sustained way going access state want. again,
really important understand backdrop neuromodulators is,
so-called baseline vary across day going able
leverage tools optimize brain chemistry. Anyone tells protocol
order increase dopamine, protocol, take supplement increase
serotonin, can telling absolute truth, don't consider
backdrop supplement behavior going effect, well,
can't really predict effect will have. can understand backdrop

leverage best tools immediate short-term

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change
circumference blood vessels arteries capillaries change way
blood flows. can change way see world, literally. change way
see world visual system. happens order
hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm
states. instance, somebody newborn child, know flooded
oxytocin, actually even called love hormone many
things addition control feelings romantic attachment attachment children,
et cetera. that, lot more, well. people new
child, also tend hyper-focused child, not just well-being,
narrow thinking, vision, hearing child
obvious adaptive reasons wanting that. recall family dinner had. Gosh,

phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much

come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis

ever case, zero dopamine zero serotonin. know, often
hear someone dopamine depleted days, hear lot
anyways. hear people's serotonin bottomed out. reality, none
neuromodulators ever disappear completely, tend present different
levels different relative levels. Another important thing point don't
work alone. fact, soon learn, dopamine epinephrine close cousins
collaborate terms creating states focus motivation, instance,
creating states energy pursuit particular goals. say close
cousins, mean tend impact neural circuits.
believe not, dopamine epinephrine chemically related, too. just tell
right now epinephrine actually derived dopamine, chemically epinephrine,
adrenaline, made molecule dopamine. Now dopamine serotonin
can also work together impact certain circuits brain. large part,
operate separate circuits. acetylcholine, soon learn involved

00:34:24 Baseline Neuromodulator Levels, 3 Daily Phases

Now perhaps surprisingly, like focus slow actions neuromodulators
first, slow actions neuromodulators happening
everyone right now, set backdrop, context various
tools manipulate dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine will work.
mean context backdrop baseline? Well, fair say


people awake daytime asleep night. realize
people going shift work raising young children,
might sick person home tending to, et cetera, even
insomnia, tending them. schedules sleep wakefulness will vary,
general, everybody, regardless whether not nocturnal you're, so-called,
diurnal, awake day, pretty much everybody follows schedule
zero nine hours waking, time wake nine
hours later, neuromodulators, dopamine epinephrine, tend highest
levels will point 24-hour period, period day.
can call zero nine hour period phase one day, just simplicity.
referred previous episode, not exact context. nine
16 hours call phase two. dopamine
epinephrine levels tend subside bit compared earlier phase one part
day serotonin levels start increase. phase three 24-hour cycle,
about, zero approximates, 17 hours
waking 24 hours waking phase three day. time,
chaos terms neuromodulators present brain.
chaos, mean sleep, incredible peaks acetylcholine

incredible peaks serotonin drops serotonin. often, not

phase three 24-hour cycle, 17 24-hour period, one
deeply asleep, whether not nocturnal diurnal, right? 17 hours
waking, asleep. lot episodes podcast.
indeed, today, started talking two particular studies related sleep,


lot tools enhance sleep, et cetera. course things can
late portion phase two day order enhance transition time
depth sleep. can't really much sleep, right? not taking
supplements. not breathing practices. things fall back asleep,
not really much sleep. mainly going focus
calling phase one phase two. Phase one, dopamine epinephrine
dominated phase day. phase two serotonergic serotonin
dominated portion day. might say, well, acetylcholine?
forgot acetylcholine? Well, didn't forget acetylcholine. Acetylcholine
control terms happen given moment,
whether not focusing not focusing, whether not learning not
learning. referring acetylcholine specifically context brain
thinking, probably shouting there, right,
exercise physiologist know anything brain controls movement,
acetylcholine used nerve muscle synapse, right? neurons don't just
control neurons electrically. way able move fact
neurons controlling electric activity muscles, literally contraction muscle

working muscles, well, not focused today. focused
can phase one day can phase two
day control specific neuromodulators, dopamine, epinephrine, serotonin,
acetylcholine, toward particular end goals. harping last five
10 minutes so, important understand early phase one part
day, again, zero nine hours, dopamine epinephrine already dominate
neuromodulator landscape. already elevated will taper off
phase two. Whereas phase two day, serotonin tends dominate
dopamine epinephrine. think that, means
goal increase serotonin order get particular effect mental

dopamine already riding pretty high, early part day, well


doesn't take whole lot get dopamine level can, instance,
change level motivation. Whereas late part day, say
eight 9:00 PM, lot serotonin swimming around system
really need focused alert, well, can leveraging
dopamine epinephrine system indeed acetylcholine system too,
going resort tools can far potently can

really important understand backdrop neuromodulators is,
so-called baseline vary across day going able

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change
circumference blood vessels arteries capillaries change way
blood flows. can change way see world, literally. change way
see world visual system. happens order
hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine
down, right? Dopamine up, prolactin down. general, way work.
take look neuromodulator systems functions
own, understanding never truly function own, can start
really make sense landscape tools available us tools
going powerful select goal instance, focused goal
less stressed goal highly motivated highly focused sake
learning. indeed possible understand four neuromodulators
understand many tools ranging pharmacologic
behavioral can tap neuromodulator systems, can kind press
gas dopamine, pull back serotonin on, particular tools,
behavioral supplementation-based, extent, prescription drug
based, too, touch those. understand work,
well, can create sort kit, grab bag things can use
context say can look depending context

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm
states. instance, somebody newborn child, know flooded

get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency
overall. don't consider depressed. course mention no
supplement either added withdrawn protocol ever used
direct replacement prescription drug treatments physician given you.
always talk physician anytime remove add something
drug protocol prescription protocol, course. got behavioral protocols
silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases
appetite libido things might not want going tinkering
serotonergic levels pathways. myo-inositol actually proving


quite useful whether not effects serotonin
effects maybe reducing anxiety, certainly
experience wake middle night, don't like waking middle
night, myo-inositol, sort seem not really care woke fall
right back asleep. direct source positive effects getting aren't clear,
nonetheless, thought pass along useful tool
available counter provided taking appropriate safety steps
considering whether not use not, think might useful tool. course,
neuromodulators discussed, baseline
serotonin ability give provide peaks serotonin
various protocols. dietary interventions sort mentioned, meaning eating

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change
circumference blood vessels arteries capillaries change way
blood flows. can change way see world, literally. change way
see world visual system. happens order
hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm
states. instance, somebody newborn child, know flooded

things addition control feelings romantic attachment attachment children,

evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright
light exposure eyes hours 10:00 PM 4:00 another way
putting realize people sleep different times, et cetera, avoid
bright light exposure eyes, not just blue light, colors light phase three,
17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,
director chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, again,
previous Huberman Lab Podcast guest, tell us bright light exposure phase three
circadian cycle, 17 24 hours waking, can dramatic effects
reducing dopamine levels way activating neural circuit involving something called
habenula. don't want get many details right now, really try keep
lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day
motivation, mood focus. course, keep mind things can suppress
dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency

hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also
fast actions. instance, adrenaline, epinephrine, released adrenal glands
can immediately make heart beat faster, can immediately change
circumference blood vessels arteries capillaries change way
blood flows. can change way see world, literally. change way
see world visual system. happens order
hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.
will provide link study again, people spend least 20 minutes
so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not
exposing cultural way, meaning wearing enough clothes
decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen
neuromodulators, dopamine serotonin, much libido feelings
well-being feelings relaxation, also desire, motivation, et cetera, originate
activation neural circuits dopamine controls promotes
serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,
hormones controlling neuromodulators slow modulatory way. yes,
said it, hormones modulate neuromodulators. sort said twice purpose.
dramatic potent effect. just give one example. hormone
prolactin tends antagonistic. tends reduce amounts dopamine least
prolactin levels high, dopamine levels tend lower. observe
birth new child, observe post coitally mating, species,
humans animals. prolactin elevated, serotonin tends elevated.
prolactin elevated, levels dopamine effects dopamine tend
subside. Now move toward explaining four categories
neuromodulators do, will start make sense
be. always say wasn't consulted design phase, meaning didn't design
circuits. anyone tells did, back away quickly
none us design circuits. way evolution nature created
systems. tend work bit seesaw fashion, prolactin up, dopamine
down, right? Dopamine up, prolactin down. general, way work.
take look neuromodulator systems functions
own, understanding never truly function own, can start
really make sense landscape tools available us tools
going powerful select goal instance, focused goal
less stressed goal highly motivated highly focused sake
learning. indeed possible understand four neuromodulators
understand many tools ranging pharmacologic
behavioral can tap neuromodulator systems, can kind press
gas dopamine, pull back serotonin on, particular tools,
behavioral supplementation-based, extent, prescription drug
based, too, touch those. understand work,
well, can create sort kit, grab bag things can use
context say can look depending context

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus
learning, not necessarily always associated learning context
highly motivated, really ramped states. can be, acetylcholine can also
released can encourage learning neuroplasticity associated calm
states. instance, somebody newborn child, know flooded

01:08:52 Tyrosine-rich Foods & Dopamine

way increase dopamine make sure baseline levels
dopamine high enough make sure eating sufficient numbers
tyrosine-rich foods. can look foods include tyrosine. Tyrosine


precursor dopamine. amino acid direct pathway dopamine synthesis
tyrosine foods include things like certain meats, Parmesan cheese, high
tyrosine, instance. fact, something called cheese effect, believe
not. don't want go far off topic, cheese effect kind interesting
certain people will take antidepressants called MAO inhibitors,
monoamine oxidase inhibitors. Anytime hear ASE, enzyme. will take
inhibitors prevent breakdown dopamine so-called
catacholamines, allow dopamine circulation. people eat
certain cheeses, including Parmesan cheese, foods, course
include not just tyrosine, one derivatives tyrosine, called tyramine,
generates called cheese effect, people get potent migraines,
headaches, blood pressure goes up. Why, well, got lot tyrosine

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,

see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,

Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap

still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back

never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.

00:42:15 Hormones Modulate Neuromodulators

order seconds, minutes hours. dive
pointed, directed effects specific tools neuromodulators, like just briefly
mention hormones also important understanding background
context baseline levels neuromodulators. Now here, going
paint bit broad brush, will say accurate, even though might not
exhaustive. mean everything say true, doesn't
cover every example detail nuanced possibility there. Hormones many
different effects brain body not unlike neuromodulators,
effects fast. slow. fact, certain hormones, instance,
steroid hormones, like estrogen like testosterone corticosteroids here,
course, referring steroid hormones are. indeed
steroid hormones, not talking steroids people inject sports
performance physical augmentation. talking steroid hormones
make naturally indeed make naturally. Well, steroid
hormones can actually control gene expression. can change identity cells


genes proteins cells express. puberty, instance,
testosterone estrogen released body, growth hormone released
body bodies voices personalities brains change tremendously
literally transformation breast tissue, testicular tissue,
ovarian tissue, bones, muscles, tissues cells control hair
growth. Gene expression changes cell types. child becomes
adolescent, becomes young adult, right? puberty really is. fact, puberty
perhaps dramatic transformation go entire lifespan
terms aging, 'cause indeed reflects rapid, mention, period
aging transformation identity cells. steroid hormones
hormones can slow long-lasting actions way. can also

hundreds milliseconds seconds, extremely fast actions. Corticosteroid
also can fast actions slow actions. since isn't discussion
hormones per se, done entire episodes like Optimize Testosterone
Estrogen episode. can find HubermanLab.com. interview
incredibly knowledgeable clear really wonderful tutor actionable information,
Dr. Kyle Gillette, also podcast, can learn lot hormones there.
Today, want think hormones relate neuromodulators,
dopamine, serotonin, epinephrine acetylcholine, general, testosterone tends
collaborate increase action dopamine. not always case,
general, testosterone goes up, dopamine goes sometimes even vice
versa. dopamine goes up, testosterone go up. true males
females. general, corticosteroids like cortisol related steroid
hormones increase, epinephrine levels go up. general, hormones like
oxytocin prolactin increased, levels serotonin go up. can't draw direct link
one hormone system acetylcholine. Acetylcholine kind sits off
category way. again, general, testosterone dopamine tend
collaborate direction. Cortisol epinephrine tend collaborate
direction. Oxytocin prolactin, hormones, serotonin tend


collaborate direction. poor old, lonely acetylcholine off
own, not poor lonely. actually incredibly potent effects own.
really just doesn't mean much help hormone systems least
not steroid hormone systems order tremendous effects. Now lot
people think will trying improve mental health physical
health will try increase decrease certain categories hormones sort
mentioned, testosterone, estrogen, oxytocin, prolactin, on. oftentimes,
effects manipulations hormones going salient not
going due direct effects hormones. Sometimes be.
oftentimes going due effects brain nervous system way
hormones impact neuromodulators. instance, various things
people can do, men women, increase testosterone estrogen
appropriate ratios. talked one approach previous episode,
get sunlight onto large portion one's skin day. Believe not,
actually works. works skin actually endocrine organ,
hormone secreting organ. beautiful study. covered podcast before.

so, closer 30 minutes, day, trying maximize sunlight exposure much
skin terms still maintaining decent exposure, meaning not

decent, still getting lot sun exposure, couple times per week more.
found people's testosterone estrogen levels went up. Feelings well-
went up. Feelings well, say increases libido observed,
well. subjectively reported passion, et cetera, testosterone estrogen
indeed go up. again, want highlight increases estrogen, not just
testosterone, related increases libido men women.
never want crush estrogen zero, whether not male female,
want maintain sort healthy libido general feelings well-being,
unrelated libido. Well, many effects know not due direct effects
testosterone estrogen, rather due effects testosterone estrogen

serotonin promote control. important understand move


toward specific discussion chemicals call neuromodulators,

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus

get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things
outside immediate possession experience. motivation pursuit
mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,
want get sort forward center mass pursuit of,
pursuit can physical. pursuit can cognitive. can cognitive
physical. can involve talking something, right?
professions, pursuit things involves talking. think lawyers, talk lot
pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered
episode immune system, want check out. Now neuromodulator
serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire
hunger thirst things don't have. serotonin molecule peace.
molecule contentness. molecule enough, least time
feeling enough time being. Now acetylcholine
fourth category neuromodulator mentioned earlier, somewhat not totally,
somewhat distinct direct control major hormone systems body,
least major steroid hormone systems. acetylcholine can say mainly
associated states focus. can go step say mainly
associated steps focus relate learning encoding new information,
called neuroplasticity. Now neuroplasticity, brain nervous system's ability
change response experience can impacted enormous number
different chemicals, not just acetylcholine, acetylcholine particularly potent


ability open thing call neuroplasticity allow plasticity happen one
moment whereas previous moment, not occur acetylcholine
not released brain spinal cord. acetylcholine involved focus

17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,
director chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, again,
previous Huberman Lab Podcast guest, tell us bright light exposure phase three
circadian cycle, 17 24 hours waking, can dramatic effects
reducing dopamine levels way activating neural circuit involving something called
habenula. don't want get many details right now, really try keep
lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day
motivation, mood focus. course, keep mind things can suppress
dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency
overall. don't consider depressed. course mention no

silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases

state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine

mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body

serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates

feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much

quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase

00:52:12 4 Major Types Neuromodulators

create states body mind want. Now again, painting
somewhat broad brush, nonetheless, accurate brush, can say dopamine,


elevated baseline, tends increase states motivation, mental
physical motivation, drive extent focus. said many times before,
say again, lot misconception dopamine. Many people
think dopamine pleasure. hear dopamine hits people
chasing dopamine need dopamine fast, et cetera. Dopamine not
pleasure. Dopamine motivation, craving pursuit goals things

mate. motivation pursuit mate. motivation pursuit food.
motivation pursuit career goal, et cetera, et cetera, things not yet have,

pursuit winning cases money, et cetera, putting people jail keeping people
jail, et cetera, done mouths, not bodies. Athletes
state motivated training motivated competition use bodies. obvious
course, perhaps not obvious one molecule not working alone,
predominantly one molecule, dopamine, responsible motivated
states, again, underscores power neuromodulators. dopamine,
can think least context today's discussion controlling indeed
promoting motivation, drive pursuit extent, focus. Epinephrine
closely related molecule called norepinephrine again, want emphasize
epinephrine adrenaline adrenaline epinephrine. Norepinephrine
noradrenaline noradrenaline norepinephrine, today going just simply
talk epinephrine norepinephrine. category neuromodulator mainly
responsible generating energy, level fuel baseline level forward
center mass, like call it. can also think high RPM are.
Now not car car analogy sort falls apart go
biology, decent one now. epinephrine levels high, tend feel
agitated, tend feel like want move, tend feel like can't shut
thinking anticipation going happen next. epinephrine
levels very, low, actually less physical energy. tend less
mental energy terms generating thoughts quickly forth.
mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates
immune system. Contrary popular belief stress inhibits immune system,
epinephrine deployed, released great levels brain body
stressed. actually protects us infections multiple kinds, least
short-term. details tools related covered

serotonin creates number different states brain body, sake
today's discussion, going think predominant states creates
states contentness, happy, feeling fairly relaxed, feeling soothed
extent, even relief pain lack pain. Serotonin associated
feeling satiety enough already have. Now serotonin
very, high, people can even sedate. can completely amotivated, no
motivation seek things like food sex work et cetera. Whereas
serotonin levels low, people can actually exhibit agitation high levels
stress. levels matter here, again, sake today's conversation,
leverage serotonin, really leveraging neuromodulator tends increase
activity neural circuits brain body make us feel relaxed happy.
tends decrease activity neural circuits make us rabidly pursuit things
don't have, right. opposite content sated motivation, desire

temperature safe, meaning not going heart attack,
uncomfortable really want get staying anywhere
one minute 10 minutes, depending cold adapted are, getting


drying off going day, unless protocol
trying extract cold. cold exposure protocol specifically
aimed increasing dopamine. people there, might think kind
silly using cold water increase dopamine. look data humans
effect cold water exposure stimulate long-lasting, significant increases
dopamine epinephrine, think agree really potent tool
provided given safely gone safely, giving kinds increases
dopamine seek using prescription pharmacology. Now shouldn't
used replacement prescription pharmacology, although people done
success. One previous guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna
Lembke, director Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic Stanford.
amazing book called "Dopamine Nation", dopamine uses, healthy,
perils things like addiction. describes patient used
deliberate cold exposure try maintain dopamine levels coming off drugs
increasing dopamine potently putting path
addiction. use cold water increasing dopamine real tool. It's,
say, power tool. fact, kind thing want increase dopamine
sake motivation, might first go-to provided also things
maintain dopamine baseline like sunlight exposure particular, making sure
getting sufficient amounts

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright
light exposure eyes hours 10:00 PM 4:00 another way
putting realize people sleep different times, et cetera, avoid
bright light exposure eyes, not just blue light, colors light phase three,
17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,
director chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, again,
previous Huberman Lab Podcast guest, tell us bright light exposure phase three
circadian cycle, 17 24 hours waking, can dramatic effects
reducing dopamine levels way activating neural circuit involving something called
habenula. don't want get many details right now, really try keep
lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day
motivation, mood focus. course, keep mind things can suppress
dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency

always talk physician anytime remove add something
drug protocol prescription protocol, course. got behavioral protocols
silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases

mentioned before, dopamine epinephrine closely related much


know fact epinephrine actually manufactured molecule
dopamine. talking two neuromodulators close
juxtaposition indeed collaborate one another. sake
today's discussion, can just think epinephrine increasing energy, adrenaline
increases energy state readiness. also, mention, activates

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available

B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels

phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency

always talk physician anytime remove add something
drug protocol prescription protocol, course. got behavioral protocols
silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves

certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency
overall. don't consider depressed. course mention no
supplement either added withdrawn protocol ever used
direct replacement prescription drug treatments physician given you.
always talk physician anytime remove add something

look behavioral tools potently increasing dopamine, vast landscape.
know based hundreds, not thousands studies things like winning
sort competition succeeding reaching goal can certainly increase
dopamine. talk lot episode dopamine, motivation drive,
leaving aside, certain behavioral protocols unrelated
overall goals motivations can increase dopamine sustained way.
without question, potent behavioral tool going deliberate,
cold exposure. Deliberate cold exposure talked lot elsewhere
terms ability things like reduce inflammation way test improve
resilience uncomfortable cold, provided applied safely great way learn


resilient essentially staying forcing stay
circumstance system flooded adrenaline. one lesser known
aspect deliberate cold exposure one demonstrated quite convincingly
humans, comes study published year 2000. link study. love
study way. Covered many times podcast love much
think truly important. study Srámek et al, entitled, "Human
physiological responses "to immersion water different temperatures". not
going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases
dopamine. Many people will ask protocols follow. instance, will cold
shower suffice? likely, yes, shower gets cold enough. need ice

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright
light exposure eyes hours 10:00 PM 4:00 another way
putting realize people sleep different times, et cetera, avoid
bright light exposure eyes, not just blue light, colors light phase three,
17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,

lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,

is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going

might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life

typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude

observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall

make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense

way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine

Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either

maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half

typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively

Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs

increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back

dopamine seek using prescription pharmacology. Now shouldn't
used replacement prescription pharmacology, although people done
success. One previous guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna
Lembke, director Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic Stanford.
amazing book called "Dopamine Nation", dopamine uses, healthy,
perils things like addiction. describes patient used
deliberate cold exposure try maintain dopamine levels coming off drugs
increasing dopamine potently putting path
addiction. use cold water increasing dopamine real tool. It's,
say, power tool. fact, kind thing want increase dopamine
sake motivation, might first go-to provided also things
maintain dopamine baseline like sunlight exposure particular, making sure
getting sufficient amounts

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright
light exposure eyes hours 10:00 PM 4:00 another way
putting realize people sleep different times, et cetera, avoid
bright light exposure eyes, not just blue light, colors light phase three,
17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,
director chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, again,
previous Huberman Lab Podcast guest, tell us bright light exposure phase three
circadian cycle, 17 24 hours waking, can dramatic effects
reducing dopamine levels way activating neural circuit involving something called
habenula. don't want get many details right now, really try keep
lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day
motivation, mood focus. course, keep mind things can suppress
dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency

silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases

look behavioral tools potently increasing dopamine, vast landscape.
know based hundreds, not thousands studies things like winning
sort competition succeeding reaching goal can certainly increase
dopamine. talk lot episode dopamine, motivation drive,
leaving aside, certain behavioral protocols unrelated
overall goals motivations can increase dopamine sustained way.
without question, potent behavioral tool going deliberate,
cold exposure. Deliberate cold exposure talked lot elsewhere
terms ability things like reduce inflammation way test improve
resilience uncomfortable cold, provided applied safely great way learn


resilient essentially staying forcing stay
circumstance system flooded adrenaline. one lesser known
aspect deliberate cold exposure one demonstrated quite convincingly
humans, comes study published year 2000. link study. love
study way. Covered many times podcast love much
think truly important. study Srámek et al, entitled, "Human
physiological responses "to immersion water different temperatures". not
going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases
dopamine. Many people will ask protocols follow. instance, will cold
shower suffice? likely, yes, shower gets cold enough. need ice
floating bath? No, temperature not whether not ice
present not. long stay there? lot details don't

provided given safely gone safely, giving kinds increases
dopamine seek using prescription pharmacology. Now shouldn't
used replacement prescription pharmacology, although people done
success. One previous guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna
Lembke, director Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic Stanford.
amazing book called "Dopamine Nation", dopamine uses, healthy,
perils things like addiction. describes patient used
deliberate cold exposure try maintain dopamine levels coming off drugs
increasing dopamine potently putting path

maintain dopamine baseline like sunlight exposure particular, making sure
getting sufficient amounts

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available
released number tools provided thus far. sufficient number
B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels
check. suspect dopamine deficiency, please talk
doctor talk ways might adjust prolactin thereby
dopamine up. way ensure dopamine levels stay high put differently,
don't quash whatever dopamine system really avoid bright
light exposure eyes hours 10:00 PM 4:00 another way
putting realize people sleep different times, et cetera, avoid
bright light exposure eyes, not just blue light, colors light phase three,
17 24 hours waking really asleep
trying get asleep, trouble sleeping. Work Samer Hattar's lab,
director chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, again,
previous Huberman Lab Podcast guest, tell us bright light exposure phase three
circadian cycle, 17 24 hours waking, can dramatic effects
reducing dopamine levels way activating neural circuit involving something called
habenula. don't want get many details right now, really try keep
lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day

dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency
overall. don't consider depressed. course mention no
supplement either added withdrawn protocol ever used
direct replacement prescription drug treatments physician given you.
always talk physician anytime remove add something
drug protocol prescription protocol, course. got behavioral protocols
silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases
appetite libido things might not want going tinkering
serotonergic levels pathways. myo-inositol actually proving


quite useful whether not effects serotonin
effects maybe reducing anxiety, certainly
experience wake middle night, don't like waking middle
night, myo-inositol, sort seem not really care woke fall
right back asleep. direct source positive effects getting aren't clear,
nonetheless, thought pass along useful tool
available counter provided taking appropriate safety steps
considering whether not use not, think might useful tool. course,
neuromodulators discussed, baseline
serotonin ability give provide peaks serotonin
various protocols. dietary interventions sort mentioned, meaning eating
foods enriched tryptophan, mainly going adjust baseline

catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine

understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know

resilient essentially staying forcing stay
circumstance system flooded adrenaline. one lesser known
aspect deliberate cold exposure one demonstrated quite convincingly

think truly important. study Srámek et al, entitled, "Human
physiological responses "to immersion water different temperatures". not
going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases
dopamine. Many people will ask protocols follow. instance, will cold

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point
quick tools good peer review data tell us can leveraged order make sure
sufficient dopamine want available

B vitamins. turns B vitamins, particular B6 vitamin B6, can potently
reduce prolactin levels. again, prolactin dopamine tend work kind push
pull fashion. said cautious taking excessive levels B6.
vitamin take much, likely excrete urine,
evidence excessively high levels B6 supplementing excessively
high levels B6 can cause peripheral neuropathy, death nerves
periphery. want know dosage levels relevant just simply look


online. lot information this. want make sure
getting enough B6, B12, et cetera, can keep prolactin levels

lights dim middle night off, can safely. really going
help turning phone brightly, turning bright lights, not just
going negatively impact melatonin, hormone helps fall stay asleep.
also going negatively impact dopamine levels, not just night,
subsequent day. less summarizes coverage ways use behavior
supplementation nutrition increase dopamine dopamine receptor efficacy
number, keep sufficient amounts dopamine system day-to-day
motivation, mood focus. course, keep mind things can suppress
dopamine, bright light exposure, elevated prolactin, on. hope
understanding tools work understanding dopamine
certain things not others can assemble versatile kit behaviors
things can order adjust dopamine levels according
particular goals. want just briefly return fact, however, riding
phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost

find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies

going go ton detail sake time, basically show
putting people cold water, mention water used
study wasn't cold. bunch different conditions, people
got into, instance, 60 degree Fahrenheit water two hours, sitting
there, lawn chair neck, long sustained increases
dopamine transmission dopamine circulation brain body. also
catacholamines, mentioned before, dopamine tends collaborate
epinephrine vice versa. Now don't need put 60 degree
Fahrenheit water get kind sustained increases. certainly don't need
two hours. strong reason believe based subsequent studies,
fact, published just last year, getting much colder water say 50
degrees 55 degrees even 45 degrees Fahrenheit can potently increase dopamine
epinephrine, well. don't need expose cold water
nearly long. perhaps even short one minute even 30 seconds
exposure really cold water, can lead potent long-lasting increases

get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools

deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust

after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back

aimed increasing dopamine. people there, might think kind
silly using cold water increase dopamine. look data humans
effect cold water exposure stimulate long-lasting, significant increases
dopamine epinephrine, think agree really potent tool
provided given safely gone safely, giving kinds increases
dopamine seek using prescription pharmacology. Now shouldn't
used replacement prescription pharmacology, although people done
success. One previous guest Huberman Lab Podcast Dr. Anna
Lembke, director Dual Diagnosis Addiction Clinic Stanford.
amazing book called "Dopamine Nation", dopamine uses, healthy,
perils things like addiction. describes patient used
deliberate cold exposure try maintain dopamine levels coming off drugs
increasing dopamine potently putting path
addiction. use cold water increasing dopamine real tool. It's,
say, power tool. fact, kind thing want increase dopamine
sake motivation, might first go-to provided also things
maintain dopamine baseline like sunlight exposure particular, making sure
getting sufficient amounts

01:21:12 Tool Kit 2: Additional Tips Increase Dopamine

tyrosine-containing foods on. now just briefly, want point

phase one, phase two background, meaning, probably going take less cold
water exposure, say less time cold water exposure early day
get big increase dopamine later day. later day,
baseline levels dopamine lower got serotonin circulating.
make sense now case. mean


really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,

after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency
overall. don't consider depressed. course mention no
supplement either added withdrawn protocol ever used
direct replacement prescription drug treatments physician given you.
always talk physician anytime remove add something
drug protocol prescription protocol, course. got behavioral protocols
silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases
serotonin things like cissus quadrangularis, things like 5-HGP may uses,
right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases
appetite libido things might not want going tinkering

quite useful whether not effects serotonin
effects maybe reducing anxiety, certainly
experience wake middle night, don't like waking middle
night, myo-inositol, sort seem not really care woke fall
right back asleep. direct source positive effects getting aren't clear,
nonetheless, thought pass along useful tool
available counter provided taking appropriate safety steps
considering whether not use not, think might useful tool. course,
neuromodulators discussed, baseline

really modify protocols dramatically? Probably not, might keep
mind if, instance, need highly motivated, focused state
late part day, whatever reason, might take tools
combination order accomplish that. Whereas somebody feels pretty
good day, kind lacking motivation want increase
dopamine levels don't yet need to, want resort prescription drugs
supplementation, well, might layer couple behavioral protocols paying
attention course, things might also potentially
suppress dopamine. again, kit tools designed play with,
choose, safe apply them, that. Consider individually,
not trying hit tools once, right? mean, throw tools
dopamine system once? Better tools kit able
deploy depending whether not travel, whether not eating
well less well, whether not sleeping well less well. highly individual
like think tools hand, able adjust
apply ways allow access dopamine increases
after.

01:26:10 Tool Kit 3: Increase Epinephrine (Adrenaline) & Alertness

next like talk epinephrine, also called adrenaline. want point
epinephrine released brain body. fact, barrier
brain body prevents epinephrine released adrenal glands,
crossing blood brain barrier. brain separate site called locus
coeruleus. collection neurons back brain kind sprinkler
rest brain epinephrine essentially wakes whatever neural circuits
happen see, say, wake circuits epinephrine happens
arrive, right, generally increase excitability networks. say
epinephrine increases energy. not talking caloric energy, although
distantly related this, really energy desire move, feeling can
think, feeling can alert. fact, look somebody eyelids
wide open, large part, lot adrenaline system.
pupils really big eyes really wide open, general, means
lot epinephrine circulating there, whereas tired kind


hood-eyed sort sleepy, pupils really small, general,
levels epinephrine also dopamine, remember work together, levels
epinephrine dopamine tend lower. also people take
drug, like again, not recommending this, amphetamine cocaine stimulant,
pupils tend huge. eyes tend wide open. don't blink often.
opposite true people take sedatives. starts make sense
think basic actions things. many people, increasing adrenaline
epinephrine might seem like crazy idea. people probably associate molecule
stress like less stressed. done entire episodes
stress, master stress, leverage stress, conquer stress.
lot great tools behavioral, supplementation-based.
Please see episode Mastering Stress tools, people,
including me, want increase levels epinephrine least early day.
somebody wakes rather slowly. fact, right waking up, rarely want
bounce bed. try push that. always impressed
chakra-willy types 4:30 five already action. tend
kind thinking thinking maybe action early day, try
push get action, can increase epinephrine. mention
physical activity, physical activity, walking, running, weight lifting,
swimming, even talking matter going increase levels epinephrine. Locus
coeruleus brain structure tightly coupled behaviors bidirectional way.
is, action, increase amount epinephrine released
locus coeruleus. wake brain. conversely, locus coeruleus active,
brain wakes up, reciprocal. goes directions. saw funny tweet
actually earlier today, something like going gym gives energy,
need energy go gym. Sounds like pyramid scheme me, made
chuckle. course overlooks fact that, indeed, energy,
likely willing get physical movement cognitive movement thinking
hard thinking lot something. also absolutely scientifically proven
action increases levels epinephrine. exercising early day
gives energy rest day. still might experience little bit crash
afternoon, especially getting extra early, drinking caffeine
close waking. talked before. drink much caffeine close
waking, going afternoon crash. Better push caffeine intake


90 120 minutes waking. know really painful certain people,
caffeine increase epinephrine. Caffeine things limit sleepiness.
pushing 90 120 minutes waking, will avoid afternoon crash
large degree. get exercise even movement kind,
hundred jumping jacks walk, can't that, anything like will increase
total amount epinephrine secrete bloodstream brain
will get energy, not just moment, throughout day. keep
mind. Exercise indeed give energy. burns caloric energy, gives
neural energy way increasing epinephrine transmission locus coeruleus.
presumably exercise intense enough, adrenaline, epinephrine release,
adrenals within body, well. exercise caffeine potent
tools increasing epinephrine thereby, energy. Another potent tool purely
behavioral, known work, based excellent studies humans. actually
laboratory similar types studies soon published,
hope, so-called cyclic hyperventilation. may familiar Wim Hof
breathing. also Tummo breathing, similar, Kundalini breathing.
styles breathing involve cyclic hyperventilation, deep inhales, either
passive exhales active exhales, repeating, inhale, exhale, inhale, exhale,
deep repetitive way. right now, doesn't matter
nose mouth, although ideally inhale nose
exhale mouth, 25 repetitions, 25 inhales
exhales, feel alert. also feel warm, why?
increased epinephrine, adrenaline release brain body. works first time
works every time increase epinephrine thereby energy. fact,
protocols great scientific studies using cyclic hyperventilation periods
minutes, not longer, instance, 25 big inhales exhales
followed brief breath hold lungs empty, repeat 25, brief breath
hold, excuse me, exhale, hold lungs empty. repeat third round,
like. over, going alert. going
energy. going feel like want move around lot more. fact,
might even feel agitated. people lot anxiety prone panic attack
might want cautious train embark type breathing, might
want approach little carefully avoid altogether. people,
cyclic hyperventilation simply going get energized feeling like


want move, feeling like can think clearly, wide-eyed
alert releasing adrenaline. cold water exposure protocol
talked earlier covered episode cold newsletter
cold. Well that, mentioned earlier, potently increases dopamine, also
epinephrine. another terrific tool, whether not applied cold shower
cold immersion thing like cryo, going make alert
releases adrenaline. Now can't really say foods increase
epinephrine. Rather, foods include lot tyrosine will increase
dopamine. remember, dopamine molecule epinephrine
synthesized. can't really point particular food categories food
increasing epinephrine. think caffeine things like will increase epinephrine.
course prescription drugs will increase epinephrine. course,
sorts so-called beta blockers will block receptors epinephrine make
feel calm public speaking various heart conditions, et cetera. really
domain physicians really worked cardiologist,
physician et cetera. think tools exercise want potent
increases adrenaline, high intensity exercise, well tools caffeine, cyclic
hyperventilation deliberate cold exposure, really combine give nice little kit,
say versatile kit, ways increase epinephrine

01:34:34 Tool Kit 4: Increase Acetylcholine & Attention/Learning; Choline-rich Foods

sake physical mental energy. next neuromodulator
acetylcholine. mentioned earlier, acetylcholine associated states focus
states focus can high energy states focus. ones
accompanied high levels dopamine epinephrine really excited
really lasered something, can calmer, relaxed states
focus like reading book practicing music listening carefully somebody
way relaxed calm. yet nonetheless, narrow cognitive
typically narrow visual aperture, typically also narrow auditory aperture.
auditory system visual system thinking can broad. can
place. can narrow. can focused. Acetylcholine
released two major sites brain, nucleus basalis, forebrain
extends connections many different brain areas offer opportunity


release acetylcholine locally less chemical way, highlight
particular neurons synapses strengthening, plasticity later. released
sites back brain way can increase so-called fidelity
information coming eyes, ears, nose, et cetera. mean
fidelity? Well, constantly bombarded sensory information
various senses acetylcholine released area back
brain, ability increase extent say, visual information just visual
auditory information make consciousness whereas
types sensory information coming filtered out. brain,
taking information needs decide pay attention to.
way, can say acetylcholine lot do, not just "focus", air quotes,
literally attention, neural signals become relevant consciousness.
whole discussion don't time that. Rather,
like focus tools one can use maintain healthy baselines
acetylcholine increase acetylcholine sake learning type information,
physical, cognitive, otherwise. Now turns lot studies,
including many quality peer reviewed studies carried humans, looking
happens increase acetylcholine levels brain accompany
attempt learn. find almost always people experience
increased focus, measured neuronal responses become specific,
less broad scale activity brain specific neural circuit activity

01:37:29 Acetylcholine Supplements: Nicotine, Alpha GPC, Huperzine

triggers immediate long-lasting changes way circuits work,
even acetylcholine not deployed, so-called neuroplasticity, circuits
literally change. great. work Michael Silver Berkeley, work Mike
Merzenich UCSF, work Michael Kilgard Texas, laboratories
see again, again. Increase acetylcholine learning.
much higher probability learning will quote, unquote, "sink in",
information will retained neural circuits change. Now ways
increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-
meat sources, chicken, fish, mushrooms, kidney beans, sorts things contain
lot choline vegetables contain choline. depending
dietary preferences needs, can select certain foods ingest, get enough
choline synthesize enough baseline acetyl choline. realm supplementation,
excellent tools increasing acetylcholine acute short-term,
meaning course 30 minutes two hours maybe even four
hours. number different molecules can that, available without
prescription, least US, pretty vast. common molecules
actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation
dopamine circuit. think triggering activation acetylcholine-related
pathways ingesting nicotine way inhalants generally bad idea. However,
people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped
toothpicks, course, nicotine gum sources nicotine. people
can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel
prize winning neuroscientist, quite well known field chewing Nicorette
day long. insists really helps focus exceedingly smart
productive, although sure reasons that. Supplements
used use increasing acetylcholine things like Alpha GPC
Huperzinene. Alpha GPC choline pathway, acetylcholine
synthesized ingest it. general logic framework works.
Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much
acetylcholine broken lead net increases acetylcholine. will often take
300 milligrams Alpha GPC prior workouts prior cognitive work bouts.
say often, tend anywhere three four times week, typically not every
day. Although people including people trying offset age-related
cognitive decline, will take 300 milligrams Alpha GPC three times day, every
day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk
stroke. think data still need data. me,
terms thinking risk benefit profiles, taking 300 milligrams Alpha GPC,
certainly increase ability focus. noticed that. tend take
alongside caffeine phenylethylamine. take combination either
workouts workbouts, really sharpens focus. again, three,
maybe four times per week. careful early part day
not disrupt sleep. Although taken Alpha GPC second half
day, no trouble sleeping all. don't know exact half life
given form typically supplementation. actually hard get information.
typically focus effects wear off two, maybe four hours maximum. Now
one thing don't think ever discussed before, certainly not podcast
take Alpha GPC, even semi-regularly, may notice particular
feature blood work will increase TMAO, sometimes
associated increased cardiovascular risk. may, again, may relate
potential risk high levels Alpha GPC ingestion many years, increasing
stroke risk. Again, studies looked people who've taking
decade, case, one way prevent increase TMAO, taking


Alpha GPC take 600 milligrams garlic contains something called
allicin. trick handed off Dr. Kyle Gillette, again,
guest podcast time ago, talking hormones hormone health.
Turns ingestion 600 milligrams allicin alongside even just day
Alpha GPC can really clamp TMAO levels otherwise increase
taking Alpha GPC. indeed done blood work turns
case. saw spike TMAO. started taking 600 milligrams garlic

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual
focus exercises order increase mental focus. not
microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase
acetylcholine. fact lead increases one's ability focus.
lot prescription drugs treatment Alzheimer's age-related cognitive
decline indeed, even drugs tap treatments ADHD also
involve acetylcholine system. nothing surprising heretical here,
important point behavioral ability focus also related ability
access deploy acetylcholine. never want purely pharmacologic treatments
way people increasing given neuromodulator. always say
behaviors first, nutrition, supplementation. need, certainly


clinical need, prescription drugs,

01:46:56 Tool Kit 6: Behavior Increase Serotonin & Feelings Well-being

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving
quite useful compound. not aware serotonergic deficiency

silly feels say, shown potently increase serotonin, things like
physical contact, cuddling, holding hands people love, course, right?
think people despise, opposite effect obvious
reasons. also receiving gratitude observing gratitude, potent increases

right? potent increasing serotonin, seem need
cycle nuanced. people respond well them, others like
don't course, always lookout dramatic even subtle decreases

day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,

Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs

increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude

increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero
cost kit available PDF website. myo-inositol known increase
circulating levels serotonin. explored extensively animal models
humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.
sorts things. explored bipolar disorder. going
episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back
up. Actually contrary, wake middle night use bathroom,
wake middle night, whatever reason, find far easier fall
back asleep taken 900 milligrams myo-inositol prior sleep. me, proving

increase acetylcholine potent way include again, nutrition supplementation.
important baseline levels acetylcholine sufficiently high, well.
really ideal situation regularly ingest foods provide enough


precursors acetylcholine made. go online search
foods contain lot choline, related synthesis acetylcholine,
get interesting information back. instance, beef liver
potent source choline. know nowadays kind growing micro trend
will, ingesting beef liver, even raw liver, honest, thought ingesting
raw liver kind activates area postrema, area brain
triggers nausea. fact, starting salivate bit, not hungry, think
whole concept makes ill. Nonetheless, cooked liver raw liver matter,
liver kind seems contain lot choline. realize people, people
not going running ingesting large amounts beef liver. Eggs contain lot
choline. Beef contains choline. Soybeans contain choline. vegan non-

actually nicotine. Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors abundant throughout body
brain. various brain circuits. muscle yes, smoking nicotine
either vaping cigarette will activate nicotinic receptors. course,
smoking terrible thing. will also activate things like lung cancer. definitely don't
recommend that. also activates addiction ways triggers activation

people will chew Nicorette nicotine type gums. never done that,
friends actually rely that. typically former smokers trying
not smoke, still want get focus enhancement experience
nicotine. people sensitive nicotine, important.
people sensitive ingested nicotine. nowadays nicotine-dipped

can take feel fine. people take feel absolutely terrible. confess,
never actually tried nicotine forms don't know work


me, people use cognitive enhancers. fact, know one Nobel

Whereas Huperzinene mainly enzymatic pathway. tends adjust much

day, closely mimic studies done humans, looking
offsetting age-related cognitive decline, using things like Alpha GPC. point
studies, few, not many, studies emphasize
people take lot Alpha GPC chronically time may increased risk

01:44:47 Tool Kit 5: Behavior Increase Focus & Acetylcholine

TMAO levels came down. last relates acetylcholine, certainly
not least, just acetylcholine can increase focus, focus can increase acetylcholine.
talked lot episode focus, behavioral tools can
use enhance focus. Things like staring particular visual target
distance going perform work 30 60
seconds, narrowing deliberate way, visual field, moving
focused work about. behavioral practice narrowing visual aperture will
increase amount acetylcholine transmission particular neural circuits will
make easier focus. know that? Well, covered episode,
peer reviewed studies relate protocols now actively
deployed schools China elsewhere, kids deliberate visual

microdialysis brain imaging kids real time, cognitive effects indeed
performance effects terms academic ability output pretty impressive.
acetylcholine increases focus. talked dietary
supplementation-based ways improve acetylcholine, say increase

et cetera, course administered physician. discuss serotonin.
Serotonin, mentioned earlier, associated brain body states well-being,
comfort, satiety, therefore come no surprise lot
prescription drug treatments things like depression involve increasing levels
serotonin brain body. said, anytime talk prescription drugs
serotonin, also want acknowledge often side effects associated
increasing serotonin, particular, serotonin levels go high, dosages
treatments go high, people will, instance, feel reduced appetite, reduced
libido, increased lethargy, et cetera. so-called serotonergic syndrome.
can considered well-trained physician,
prescription drugs, controlling dosage, deciding dosage take, deciding
SSRI take whether not come off drugs, come off drugs.
Again, handled licensed physician. said,
behavioral tools, nutritional tools, supplementation tools can tap
serotonin system, not degree potency, nonetheless, ways can
still impact feelings well-being positive ways. focus first
behavioral tools might make people chuckle little bit, want
point lot tools quite potent. fact, power tools
modulating serotonin. know based human neuro imaging studies, human
animal microdialysis studies studies really evaluated circulating
levels serotonin particular brain circuits release serotonin people
certain things. sorts things? Well, instance, physical contact, particular
loved ones, can romantic love. can children, children
spouse, even not sexual contact, friend friend contact, even friend animal
contact, know, former dog owner, hope another dog soon 'cause
unfortunately Costello passed away, something really comforting
wonderful petting dog. certainly, given many studies
serotonin neuromodulators done animal models, also know
serotonin evoked dog course child significant
other, et cetera. things like holding hands, believe not, hugs, cuddling, et cetera,


can increase serotonin transmission make people feel good. shouldn't
really come surprise. also gratitude. entire episode
gratitude. lot misunderstanding gratitude. Oftentimes people
hear gratitude, think, oh, gratitude, just thankful
kind weak sauce effect, meaning, know, kind like, maybe little
serotonin goes maybe little bit increased feelings well-being. Nothing
truth. turns out, first all, receiving not giving gratitude
potent effects increasing serotonin activity brain circuits
involve serotonin lead increases feelings well-being.
interesting. Receiving much giving gratitude activates
serotonergic pathways. takeaway give receive gratitude
course, authentic way. thing gratitude somewhat
counterintuitive observing others giving receiving gratitude immensely
powerful evoking serotonin activity serotonergic circuits you,
observer. receiving observing gratitude turns potent way
increase serotonin brain body. dramatic effects
quite long-lasting not sorts effects

01:50:51 Tools: Tryptophan-Rich Foods & Serotonin

going lead side effects, least no reason think would. Now
nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just
tyrosine amino acid precursor upstream dopamine synthesis,
amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount
serotonin available brain body. kind famous infamous
white meat turkey, so-called tryptophan effect people get sleepy
eating white meat turkey. indeed highly enriched tryptophan although typically
getting sleepy eating turkey often associated Thanksgiving
meal Thanksgiving meal, least US, often associated people
vastly overeating. want point fill gut food, no
matter food is, going diversion blood gut going
make feel sleepy diversion blood away tissues.


eat lot, going get sleepy, period, whether not eat turkey
substance. Nonetheless, number foods contain lot
tryptophan people will leverage order try increase total
amount circulating serotonin available order modest increase
overall mood well-being. foods? things like
milk, particular, whole milk, full fat milk. know number people choose not
drink milk 'cause lactose intolerant. raising hand 'cause one
person, although kid, enjoy milk. Canned tuna. Turkey,
mentioned before, high tryptophan. Oats, consumer oatmeal
resonates me. Cheese read, although not high tryptophan meat
dairy sources, certain cheeses like cheddar cheeses can rich tryptophan.
Certain nuts seeds, certain breads. Chocolate, know number people will
relieved hear that. know chocolate lovers always looking excuse eat
chocolate. confess never really liked chocolate, except dare say, like smooth
100% percent chocolates. know many people gag hear hundred percent,
actually really like them. fruits can highly enriched tryptophan,
things like bananas apples things sort, although not nearly degree
things like turkey, canned tuna milk. sure excellent sources
tryptophan diet, including vegan sources please peruse internet try
find sources compatible nutritional program,

01:53:31 Tools: Serotonin Supplements: Cissus Quadrangularis, 5-HTP, Myo-inositol

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
increasing attention lately cissus quadrangularis, complicated name, taken
dosages 300 600 milligrams can pretty dramatically increase serotonin
levels. fact, anywhere 30% 39% increases circulating serotonin. big
increase can provide link study. study focused, not much
serotonin, focused mainly treatment obesity appetite weight loss.
come no surprise serotonin, increased, might lead decreases
appetite. cautionary note, cissus quadrangularis may need cycled.
quickly cycle it, meaning two weeks on, two weeks off? Whether not
need rapid cycling like two days on, two days off, matter debate.


not lot data just yet. lot opinions internet,
again, not lot quality peer review data. Nonetheless cissus quadrangularis
shown increase serotonin humans people seeking increase
serotonin maybe particular, sake appetite weight control, might
useful compound. know many people also take 5-HTP, one precursors
serotonin dosages anywhere 300 500 milligrams. Typically people
anticipation sleep, meaning final hour wakefulness going
sleep. tried 5-HTP prior sleep can tell led
deep sleep one three hours. woke not fall back
asleep. ran experiment twice decided abandon 5-HTP sleep aid.
never put sleep kit least sleep kit. refer
sleep kit, something can find HubermanLab.com. zero cost
resource can see behavioral tools also supplementation tools can
improve transition time depth sleep. none rely 5-HTP
supplementation. said, know number people use 5-HTP supplementation
outside sleep, say daytime try increase serotonin
will indeed increase circulating serotonin. again, people vary sensitivity
sorts things. people might find instance, 300 milligrams 5-HTP
just far much. blunts appetite, might even reduce libido. aren't lot
well controlled studies looking figured individual
basis, decide approach all. Now one molecule found
particularly interesting useful one haven't talked yet
podcast inositol, particular myo-inositol. Myo-inositol can effect
increasing serotonin neurochemicals, primarily least terms
neuromodulators discussed today, serotonin. taking 900 milligrams myo-
inositol every third night test ability improve sleep. say,
depth quality sleep obtaining myo-inositol pretty
remarkable. fact, used alone combination magnesium threonate,
apigenin, theanine sleep kit talked included that, again, zero

humans daytime use treating anxiety. seem reduce anxiety.

episode bipolar disorder coming up. explored treatment


migraine. explored ADHD. explored huge number different
conditions brain body. Again, using 900 milligrams myo-inositol
30 60 minutes sleep improve sleep
dramatically, especially take alongside rest sleep kit supplements.
quick note myo-inositol sake increasing serotonin. look human
studies myo-inositol particular focus human studies,
find dosages often used tremendously high, things like
five grams, eight grams, 18 grams myo-inositol taken throughout day. don't know
people stomach that. fact, many people drop studies
gastric discomfort. yet also wonder people tolerate
somewhat sedative effect kind anti-anxiety effect. can't even
imagine given experience 900 milligrams, one experience taking
multiple many grams per day. certainly not encouraging that.
reason mention myo-inositol known effect increasing serotonin.
least experience, not lead falling deeply asleep waking back

nutritional approaches increasing serotonin? Well, just

amino acid tryptophan, upstream serotonin synthesis. one simply
go online put tryptophan containing foods will discover lot
foods enriched tryptophan can lead net increases amount

indeed goal increase tryptophan. Now supplements can
increase tryptophan can quite potently. One ones received
