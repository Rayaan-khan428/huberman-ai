seven-day free trial 25% off. now discussion Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
Wendy, great see here, little while. -
while, great here, Andrew. thank much me. - Yeah, delighted.
like start off talking memory generally, love chat
incredible work, discovering exercise memory interface people can


improve memory brain function generally. - Yes. - not
familiar, maybe just step us basic elements memory,
brain structures, perhaps. - Sure. - know, happens I, instance,
mug tea pretty unremarkable. fact now talked it, don't know
ever forget it. Maybe will, maybe won't. happens look
mug decide something special whatever reason? - Yeah, well, like
say four things make things memorable. Number one novelty.
something new, first thing, first time seen something
experienced something, brains drawn that, attentional systems draw us
that. paying attention something, part makes things
memorable. Second repetition. see cup tea every single day, every
single time interview talk cup tea, going remember
it. just brains work, repetition works. Third association. meet
somebody new knows lots people know, share many, many,
many, many people know. easy remember, easier remember
you, especially somebody new hadn't met before, met before,
association. fourth one emotional resonance. remember
happiest saddest moments lives, also includes funny, surprising
things. interaction two key brain structures, amygdala,
important processing lots emotional, particularly threatening kinds situations,
threatening, surprising kinds situations, amygdala takes information
makes another key structure called hippocampus work better put new long-term
memories brain. that, fact, key structure long-term memory,
structure called hippocampus.

00:10:14 Hippocampus: Memory, Association & Imagination

- Fantastic, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. - Yes. -
tell us bit hippocampus? think, least generation, well,
neuroscientist, people generation, think first heard
hippocampus movie "Memento." - Oh yeah, yeah. - guy says
hippocampus, haven't seen movie, bizarrely
constructed movie, interesting one, nonetheless, memory. even
neuroscientist, sometimes perplexed hippocampus works. Maybe


could, would, step us kind structure is, looks like,
maybe subregions, unlike vision, topic worked
career on, know, okay, eye part, thalamus
part, cortex part, always little perplexed
hippocampus, frankly. read textbooks heard lectures,
love get update. general themes hippocampus structure
function? think everyone, including neuroscientists, know
hippocampus? - Absolutely, start basics. word
hippocampus means seahorse. shaped, structure shaped, like kind
curlicue seahorse, accurate. Everybody, including neuroscientists, know
beautiful structure. visually, anatomically beautiful kind
intertwining twirly subregions within it. think one reasons early
anatomists, first neuroscientists, got attracted
interesting kind twirly structure deep heart brain. anatomically.
Functionally, do? Well, easiest understand look
happens don't hippocampus anymore. you,
disease, hippocampus removed accident, happens? Well,
know famous neurological patient time, initials HM,
psychology neuroscience students know him. operated 1954
paper published 1957. removed hippocampi
terrible epilepsy knew hippocampus genesis epilepsy.
experimental, epilepsy bad decided not just remove one
hippocampus, both. happened immediate loss ability form
new memories facts events. Think second, facts events
not able remember. can't remember interaction us. can't
remember facts just chatting neuroscience lives.
None can move long-term memory. hippocampus something
perceptions coming us every single day, every minute
day, not them, features just
talked about, maybe novel, maybe associations, maybe
emotionally relevant, maybe repeated, things realm
facts events get encoded long-term memory. textbook
hippocampus important. like always add, mean, studied
many years, hippocampus really defines personal


histories. means defines are, can't remember
done, information learned, events lives, changes us,
really defines us. wanted study hippocampus. think
exciting, new ideas hippocampus it's, know, hippocampus
important memory, say that, impress people cocktail
party, people started realize not just memory, not just
putting together associations what, where, events happened
past, putting together information long-term memory banks
interesting new ways. talking imagination. without hippocampus, yes,
can't remember things, actually not able imagine events situations
never experienced before. says hippocampus important
memory simple way think it. hippocampus important
already talked about, associating things together writ large. Anytime
need associate something together, either past, present, future,
using hippocampus. takes much important role
cognitive lives think like that. kind new hippocampus
neuroscientists studying days. - fantastic, sounds like really sets
context, can elements past, present, future. - Yes. -
neuroscientists phrase domain, say time domain meaning
opposed just evaluating things space, sounds like time domain
hippocampal functioning incredibly interesting. - is. - even fact can
short-term,

00:16:20 Encoding Long-Term Memory

medium-term, long-term memories, go rabbit holes.
ask true false, mostly just really want know answer.
years ago, theme various high-profile reviews seemed hippocampus
involved encoding, creating memories, not storing memories
memory storage neocortex overlying areas brain.
general statement? - tricky statement think ultimately, yes,
long-term memories stored cortex, memories stored
hippocampus sometimes very, long time. long long
say, oh, not hippocampus anymore? four years, mean not


stored hippocampus? think tricky question. yes, coming
lot people debating people think shouldn't think
hippocampus storage area, think long, long, long-term kind
intermediate storage area, maybe not long-term storage area. hard
answer question. - Great, recall, HM remember facts
surgery. - Yes. - couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - given no
hippocampus, least partially support idea memories
retained outside hippocampus. - However, part posterior
hippocampus intact. tricky thing. think initially, fact, Scoville,
neurosurgeon overestimated number millimeters intended remove
hippocampus. this, historic MRI HM later life,
showed that, fact, part posterior hippocampus intact.
now makes little bit complicated interpret going on. Not
never uncomplicated, interpretation lesion patient, know,
complicated, HM mythical role neuroscience neurology now
complicated

00:18:48 One-Trial Memory

hippocampus intact. - Got it, not know that. memories
can formed quickly, called one-trial learning, just looking
list again, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. seems like
experiences can bypass need multiple repetitions. - Yeah, absolutely. -
unfortunately seems nervous system skewed toward creating one-trial
memories negative events. - Right. - survival adaptive mechanism.
neural connection allows happen? amygdala
hippocampus connection? mean, know, seems like every brain area
ultimately connected everything else. just question many
nodes, just like every city connected another city, just question many
flights roads traverse get there. one-trial
learning? mean, kind top contour level, can learn certain things fast
things tricky? now every time look white mug, queuing
something special simply virtue saying it. one-trial memory?
emotionally salient events allow memories get stamped in? - Yeah,


mean, think already alluded it. protective function
brains evolved last 2.5 million years need pay attention
remember certain things survival. things get stamped in,
memories, fear memories. get mugged subway or, know,
terrible things happen subway just learned. something
terrible happens, something scary happens, remember that, fear
memory things, mean, one lived Washington, DC,
went work NIH Sunday afternoon came back rounded
corner door apartment, crowbarred in. Somebody taken
crowbar, opened door, stole nicest things apartment,
wasn't nice, 'cause wasn't making much money. ever since then,
whenever rounded corner, still memory. terrible put
terrible state just coming home survival mechanism.
want alert possible danger? Absolutely yes. part one-trial memories,
think, often taking advantage evolutionarily developed system tamp
things potentially dangerous memory. forever will
remember particular corner

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want

seven-day free trial 25% off. now discussion Dr. Wendy Suzuki.
Wendy, great see here, little while. -
while, great here, Andrew. thank much me. - Yeah, delighted.
like start off talking memory generally, love chat
incredible work, discovering exercise memory interface people can


improve memory brain function generally. - Yes. - not
familiar, maybe just step us basic elements memory,
brain structures, perhaps. - Sure. - know, happens I, instance,
mug tea pretty unremarkable. fact now talked it, don't know
ever forget it. Maybe will, maybe won't. happens look
mug decide something special whatever reason? - Yeah, well, like
say four things make things memorable. Number one novelty.
something new, first thing, first time seen something
experienced something, brains drawn that, attentional systems draw us
that. paying attention something, part makes things
memorable. Second repetition. see cup tea every single day, every
single time interview talk cup tea, going remember
it. just brains work, repetition works. Third association. meet
somebody new knows lots people know, share many, many,
many, many people know. easy remember, easier remember
you, especially somebody new hadn't met before, met before,
association. fourth one emotional resonance. remember
happiest saddest moments lives, also includes funny, surprising
things. interaction two key brain structures, amygdala,
important processing lots emotional, particularly threatening kinds situations,
threatening, surprising kinds situations, amygdala takes information
makes another key structure called hippocampus work better put new long-term
memories brain. that, fact, key structure long-term memory,
structure called hippocampus.

00:10:14 Hippocampus: Memory, Association & Imagination

- Fantastic, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. - Yes. -
tell us bit hippocampus? think, least generation, well,
neuroscientist, people generation, think first heard
hippocampus movie "Memento." - Oh yeah, yeah. - guy says
hippocampus, haven't seen movie, bizarrely
constructed movie, interesting one, nonetheless, memory. even
neuroscientist, sometimes perplexed hippocampus works. Maybe


could, would, step us kind structure is, looks like,
maybe subregions, unlike vision, topic worked
career on, know, okay, eye part, thalamus
part, cortex part, always little perplexed
hippocampus, frankly. read textbooks heard lectures,
love get update. general themes hippocampus structure
function? think everyone, including neuroscientists, know
hippocampus? - Absolutely, start basics. word
hippocampus means seahorse. shaped, structure shaped, like kind
curlicue seahorse, accurate. Everybody, including neuroscientists, know
beautiful structure. visually, anatomically beautiful kind
intertwining twirly subregions within it. think one reasons early
anatomists, first neuroscientists, got attracted
interesting kind twirly structure deep heart brain. anatomically.
Functionally, do? Well, easiest understand look
happens don't hippocampus anymore. you,
disease, hippocampus removed accident, happens? Well,
know famous neurological patient time, initials HM,
psychology neuroscience students know him. operated 1954
paper published 1957. removed hippocampi
terrible epilepsy knew hippocampus genesis epilepsy.
experimental, epilepsy bad decided not just remove one
hippocampus, both. happened immediate loss ability form
new memories facts events. Think second, facts events
not able remember. can't remember interaction us. can't
remember facts just chatting neuroscience lives.
None can move long-term memory. hippocampus something
perceptions coming us every single day, every minute
day, not them, features just
talked about, maybe novel, maybe associations, maybe
emotionally relevant, maybe repeated, things realm
facts events get encoded long-term memory. textbook
hippocampus important. like always add, mean, studied
many years, hippocampus really defines personal


histories. means defines are, can't remember
done, information learned, events lives, changes us,
really defines us. wanted study hippocampus. think
exciting, new ideas hippocampus it's, know, hippocampus
important memory, say that, impress people cocktail
party, people started realize not just memory, not just
putting together associations what, where, events happened
past, putting together information long-term memory banks
interesting new ways. talking imagination. without hippocampus, yes,
can't remember things, actually not able imagine events situations
never experienced before. says hippocampus important
memory simple way think it. hippocampus important
already talked about, associating things together writ large. Anytime
need associate something together, either past, present, future,
using hippocampus. takes much important role
cognitive lives think like that. kind new hippocampus
neuroscientists studying days. - fantastic, sounds like really sets
context, can elements past, present, future. - Yes. -
neuroscientists phrase domain, say time domain meaning
opposed just evaluating things space, sounds like time domain
hippocampal functioning incredibly interesting. - is. - even fact can
short-term,

00:16:20 Encoding Long-Term Memory

medium-term, long-term memories, go rabbit holes.
ask true false, mostly just really want know answer.
years ago, theme various high-profile reviews seemed hippocampus
involved encoding, creating memories, not storing memories
memory storage neocortex overlying areas brain.
general statement? - tricky statement think ultimately, yes,
long-term memories stored cortex, memories stored
hippocampus sometimes very, long time. long long
say, oh, not hippocampus anymore? four years, mean not


stored hippocampus? think tricky question. yes, coming
lot people debating people think shouldn't think
hippocampus storage area, think long, long, long-term kind
intermediate storage area, maybe not long-term storage area. hard
answer question. - Great, recall, HM remember facts
surgery. - Yes. - couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - given no
hippocampus, least partially support idea memories
retained outside hippocampus. - However, part posterior
hippocampus intact. tricky thing. think initially, fact, Scoville,
neurosurgeon overestimated number millimeters intended remove
hippocampus. this, historic MRI HM later life,
showed that, fact, part posterior hippocampus intact.
now makes little bit complicated interpret going on. Not
never uncomplicated, interpretation lesion patient, know,
complicated, HM mythical role neuroscience neurology now
complicated

00:18:48 One-Trial Memory

hippocampus intact. - Got it, not know that. memories
can formed quickly, called one-trial learning, just looking
list again, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. seems like
experiences can bypass need multiple repetitions. - Yeah, absolutely. -
unfortunately seems nervous system skewed toward creating one-trial
memories negative events. - Right. - survival adaptive mechanism.
neural connection allows happen? amygdala
hippocampus connection? mean, know, seems like every brain area
ultimately connected everything else. just question many
nodes, just like every city connected another city, just question many
flights roads traverse get there. one-trial
learning? mean, kind top contour level, can learn certain things fast
things tricky? now every time look white mug, queuing
something special simply virtue saying it. one-trial memory?
emotionally salient events allow memories get stamped in? - Yeah,


mean, think already alluded it. protective function
brains evolved last 2.5 million years need pay attention
remember certain things survival. things get stamped in,
memories, fear memories. get mugged subway or, know,
terrible things happen subway just learned. something
terrible happens, something scary happens, remember that, fear
memory things, mean, one lived Washington, DC,
went work NIH Sunday afternoon came back rounded
corner door apartment, crowbarred in. Somebody taken
crowbar, opened door, stole nicest things apartment,
wasn't nice, 'cause wasn't making much money. ever since then,
whenever rounded corner, still memory. terrible put
terrible state just coming home survival mechanism.
want alert possible danger? Absolutely yes. part one-trial memories,
think, often taking advantage evolutionarily developed system tamp
things potentially dangerous memory. forever will
remember particular corner

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much

improve memory brain function generally. - Yes. - not
familiar, maybe just step us basic elements memory,
brain structures, perhaps. - Sure. - know, happens I, instance,
mug tea pretty unremarkable. fact now talked it, don't know
ever forget it. Maybe will, maybe won't. happens look
mug decide something special whatever reason? - Yeah, well, like
say four things make things memorable. Number one novelty.
something new, first thing, first time seen something
experienced something, brains drawn that, attentional systems draw us
that. paying attention something, part makes things
memorable. Second repetition. see cup tea every single day, every
single time interview talk cup tea, going remember
it. just brains work, repetition works. Third association. meet
somebody new knows lots people know, share many, many,
many, many people know. easy remember, easier remember
you, especially somebody new hadn't met before, met before,
association. fourth one emotional resonance. remember
happiest saddest moments lives, also includes funny, surprising
things. interaction two key brain structures, amygdala,
important processing lots emotional, particularly threatening kinds situations,
threatening, surprising kinds situations, amygdala takes information
makes another key structure called hippocampus work better put new long-term
memories brain. that, fact, key structure long-term memory,
structure called hippocampus.

00:10:14 Hippocampus: Memory, Association & Imagination

- Fantastic, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. - Yes. -
tell us bit hippocampus? think, least generation, well,
neuroscientist, people generation, think first heard
hippocampus movie "Memento." - Oh yeah, yeah. - guy says
hippocampus, haven't seen movie, bizarrely
constructed movie, interesting one, nonetheless, memory. even
neuroscientist, sometimes perplexed hippocampus works. Maybe


could, would, step us kind structure is, looks like,
maybe subregions, unlike vision, topic worked
career on, know, okay, eye part, thalamus
part, cortex part, always little perplexed
hippocampus, frankly. read textbooks heard lectures,
love get update. general themes hippocampus structure
function? think everyone, including neuroscientists, know
hippocampus? - Absolutely, start basics. word
hippocampus means seahorse. shaped, structure shaped, like kind
curlicue seahorse, accurate. Everybody, including neuroscientists, know
beautiful structure. visually, anatomically beautiful kind
intertwining twirly subregions within it. think one reasons early
anatomists, first neuroscientists, got attracted
interesting kind twirly structure deep heart brain. anatomically.
Functionally, do? Well, easiest understand look
happens don't hippocampus anymore. you,
disease, hippocampus removed accident, happens? Well,
know famous neurological patient time, initials HM,
psychology neuroscience students know him. operated 1954
paper published 1957. removed hippocampi
terrible epilepsy knew hippocampus genesis epilepsy.
experimental, epilepsy bad decided not just remove one
hippocampus, both. happened immediate loss ability form
new memories facts events. Think second, facts events
not able remember. can't remember interaction us. can't
remember facts just chatting neuroscience lives.
None can move long-term memory. hippocampus something
perceptions coming us every single day, every minute
day, not them, features just
talked about, maybe novel, maybe associations, maybe
emotionally relevant, maybe repeated, things realm
facts events get encoded long-term memory. textbook
hippocampus important. like always add, mean, studied
many years, hippocampus really defines personal


histories. means defines are, can't remember
done, information learned, events lives, changes us,
really defines us. wanted study hippocampus. think
exciting, new ideas hippocampus it's, know, hippocampus
important memory, say that, impress people cocktail
party, people started realize not just memory, not just
putting together associations what, where, events happened
past, putting together information long-term memory banks
interesting new ways. talking imagination. without hippocampus, yes,
can't remember things, actually not able imagine events situations
never experienced before. says hippocampus important
memory simple way think it. hippocampus important
already talked about, associating things together writ large. Anytime
need associate something together, either past, present, future,
using hippocampus. takes much important role
cognitive lives think like that. kind new hippocampus
neuroscientists studying days. - fantastic, sounds like really sets
context, can elements past, present, future. - Yes. -
neuroscientists phrase domain, say time domain meaning
opposed just evaluating things space, sounds like time domain
hippocampal functioning incredibly interesting. - is. - even fact can
short-term,

00:16:20 Encoding Long-Term Memory

medium-term, long-term memories, go rabbit holes.
ask true false, mostly just really want know answer.
years ago, theme various high-profile reviews seemed hippocampus
involved encoding, creating memories, not storing memories
memory storage neocortex overlying areas brain.
general statement? - tricky statement think ultimately, yes,
long-term memories stored cortex, memories stored
hippocampus sometimes very, long time. long long
say, oh, not hippocampus anymore? four years, mean not


stored hippocampus? think tricky question. yes, coming
lot people debating people think shouldn't think
hippocampus storage area, think long, long, long-term kind
intermediate storage area, maybe not long-term storage area. hard
answer question. - Great, recall, HM remember facts
surgery. - Yes. - couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - given no
hippocampus, least partially support idea memories
retained outside hippocampus. - However, part posterior
hippocampus intact. tricky thing. think initially, fact, Scoville,
neurosurgeon overestimated number millimeters intended remove
hippocampus. this, historic MRI HM later life,
showed that, fact, part posterior hippocampus intact.
now makes little bit complicated interpret going on. Not
never uncomplicated, interpretation lesion patient, know,
complicated, HM mythical role neuroscience neurology now
complicated

00:18:48 One-Trial Memory

hippocampus intact. - Got it, not know that. memories
can formed quickly, called one-trial learning, just looking
list again, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. seems like
experiences can bypass need multiple repetitions. - Yeah, absolutely. -
unfortunately seems nervous system skewed toward creating one-trial
memories negative events. - Right. - survival adaptive mechanism.
neural connection allows happen? amygdala
hippocampus connection? mean, know, seems like every brain area
ultimately connected everything else. just question many
nodes, just like every city connected another city, just question many
flights roads traverse get there. one-trial
learning? mean, kind top contour level, can learn certain things fast
things tricky? now every time look white mug, queuing
something special simply virtue saying it. one-trial memory?
emotionally salient events allow memories get stamped in? - Yeah,


mean, think already alluded it. protective function
brains evolved last 2.5 million years need pay attention
remember certain things survival. things get stamped in,
memories, fear memories. get mugged subway or, know,
terrible things happen subway just learned. something
terrible happens, something scary happens, remember that, fear
memory things, mean, one lived Washington, DC,
went work NIH Sunday afternoon came back rounded
corner door apartment, crowbarred in. Somebody taken
crowbar, opened door, stole nicest things apartment,
wasn't nice, 'cause wasn't making much money. ever since then,
whenever rounded corner, still memory. terrible put
terrible state just coming home survival mechanism.
want alert possible danger? Absolutely yes. part one-trial memories,
think, often taking advantage evolutionarily developed system tamp
things potentially dangerous memory. forever will
remember particular corner

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university

could, would, step us kind structure is, looks like,
maybe subregions, unlike vision, topic worked
career on, know, okay, eye part, thalamus
part, cortex part, always little perplexed
hippocampus, frankly. read textbooks heard lectures,
love get update. general themes hippocampus structure
function? think everyone, including neuroscientists, know
hippocampus? - Absolutely, start basics. word
hippocampus means seahorse. shaped, structure shaped, like kind
curlicue seahorse, accurate. Everybody, including neuroscientists, know
beautiful structure. visually, anatomically beautiful kind
intertwining twirly subregions within it. think one reasons early
anatomists, first neuroscientists, got attracted
interesting kind twirly structure deep heart brain. anatomically.
Functionally, do? Well, easiest understand look
happens don't hippocampus anymore. you,
disease, hippocampus removed accident, happens? Well,
know famous neurological patient time, initials HM,
psychology neuroscience students know him. operated 1954
paper published 1957. removed hippocampi
terrible epilepsy knew hippocampus genesis epilepsy.
experimental, epilepsy bad decided not just remove one
hippocampus, both. happened immediate loss ability form
new memories facts events. Think second, facts events
not able remember. can't remember interaction us. can't
remember facts just chatting neuroscience lives.
None can move long-term memory. hippocampus something
perceptions coming us every single day, every minute
day, not them, features just
talked about, maybe novel, maybe associations, maybe
emotionally relevant, maybe repeated, things realm
facts events get encoded long-term memory. textbook
hippocampus important. like always add, mean, studied
many years, hippocampus really defines personal


histories. means defines are, can't remember
done, information learned, events lives, changes us,
really defines us. wanted study hippocampus. think
exciting, new ideas hippocampus it's, know, hippocampus
important memory, say that, impress people cocktail
party, people started realize not just memory, not just
putting together associations what, where, events happened
past, putting together information long-term memory banks
interesting new ways. talking imagination. without hippocampus, yes,
can't remember things, actually not able imagine events situations
never experienced before. says hippocampus important
memory simple way think it. hippocampus important
already talked about, associating things together writ large. Anytime
need associate something together, either past, present, future,
using hippocampus. takes much important role
cognitive lives think like that. kind new hippocampus
neuroscientists studying days. - fantastic, sounds like really sets
context, can elements past, present, future. - Yes. -
neuroscientists phrase domain, say time domain meaning
opposed just evaluating things space, sounds like time domain
hippocampal functioning incredibly interesting. - is. - even fact can
short-term,

00:16:20 Encoding Long-Term Memory

medium-term, long-term memories, go rabbit holes.
ask true false, mostly just really want know answer.
years ago, theme various high-profile reviews seemed hippocampus
involved encoding, creating memories, not storing memories
memory storage neocortex overlying areas brain.
general statement? - tricky statement think ultimately, yes,
long-term memories stored cortex, memories stored
hippocampus sometimes very, long time. long long
say, oh, not hippocampus anymore? four years, mean not


stored hippocampus? think tricky question. yes, coming
lot people debating people think shouldn't think
hippocampus storage area, think long, long, long-term kind
intermediate storage area, maybe not long-term storage area. hard
answer question. - Great, recall, HM remember facts
surgery. - Yes. - couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - given no
hippocampus, least partially support idea memories
retained outside hippocampus. - However, part posterior
hippocampus intact. tricky thing. think initially, fact, Scoville,
neurosurgeon overestimated number millimeters intended remove
hippocampus. this, historic MRI HM later life,
showed that, fact, part posterior hippocampus intact.
now makes little bit complicated interpret going on. Not
never uncomplicated, interpretation lesion patient, know,
complicated, HM mythical role neuroscience neurology now
complicated

00:18:48 One-Trial Memory

hippocampus intact. - Got it, not know that. memories
can formed quickly, called one-trial learning, just looking
list again, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. seems like
experiences can bypass need multiple repetitions. - Yeah, absolutely. -
unfortunately seems nervous system skewed toward creating one-trial
memories negative events. - Right. - survival adaptive mechanism.
neural connection allows happen? amygdala
hippocampus connection? mean, know, seems like every brain area
ultimately connected everything else. just question many
nodes, just like every city connected another city, just question many
flights roads traverse get there. one-trial
learning? mean, kind top contour level, can learn certain things fast
things tricky? now every time look white mug, queuing
something special simply virtue saying it. one-trial memory?
emotionally salient events allow memories get stamped in? - Yeah,


mean, think already alluded it. protective function
brains evolved last 2.5 million years need pay attention
remember certain things survival. things get stamped in,
memories, fear memories. get mugged subway or, know,
terrible things happen subway just learned. something
terrible happens, something scary happens, remember that, fear
memory things, mean, one lived Washington, DC,
went work NIH Sunday afternoon came back rounded
corner door apartment, crowbarred in. Somebody taken
crowbar, opened door, stole nicest things apartment,
wasn't nice, 'cause wasn't making much money. ever since then,
whenever rounded corner, still memory. terrible put
terrible state just coming home survival mechanism.
want alert possible danger? Absolutely yes. part one-trial memories,
think, often taking advantage evolutionarily developed system tamp
things potentially dangerous memory. forever will
remember particular corner

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure

Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work

histories. means defines are, can't remember
done, information learned, events lives, changes us,
really defines us. wanted study hippocampus. think
exciting, new ideas hippocampus it's, know, hippocampus
important memory, say that, impress people cocktail
party, people started realize not just memory, not just
putting together associations what, where, events happened
past, putting together information long-term memory banks
interesting new ways. talking imagination. without hippocampus, yes,
can't remember things, actually not able imagine events situations
never experienced before. says hippocampus important
memory simple way think it. hippocampus important
already talked about, associating things together writ large. Anytime
need associate something together, either past, present, future,
using hippocampus. takes much important role
cognitive lives think like that. kind new hippocampus
neuroscientists studying days. - fantastic, sounds like really sets
context, can elements past, present, future. - Yes. -
neuroscientists phrase domain, say time domain meaning
opposed just evaluating things space, sounds like time domain
hippocampal functioning incredibly interesting. - is. - even fact can
short-term,

00:16:20 Encoding Long-Term Memory

medium-term, long-term memories, go rabbit holes.
ask true false, mostly just really want know answer.
years ago, theme various high-profile reviews seemed hippocampus
involved encoding, creating memories, not storing memories
memory storage neocortex overlying areas brain.
general statement? - tricky statement think ultimately, yes,
long-term memories stored cortex, memories stored
hippocampus sometimes very, long time. long long
say, oh, not hippocampus anymore? four years, mean not


stored hippocampus? think tricky question. yes, coming
lot people debating people think shouldn't think
hippocampus storage area, think long, long, long-term kind
intermediate storage area, maybe not long-term storage area. hard
answer question. - Great, recall, HM remember facts
surgery. - Yes. - couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - given no
hippocampus, least partially support idea memories
retained outside hippocampus. - However, part posterior
hippocampus intact. tricky thing. think initially, fact, Scoville,
neurosurgeon overestimated number millimeters intended remove
hippocampus. this, historic MRI HM later life,
showed that, fact, part posterior hippocampus intact.
now makes little bit complicated interpret going on. Not
never uncomplicated, interpretation lesion patient, know,
complicated, HM mythical role neuroscience neurology now
complicated

00:18:48 One-Trial Memory

hippocampus intact. - Got it, not know that. memories
can formed quickly, called one-trial learning, just looking
list again, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. seems like
experiences can bypass need multiple repetitions. - Yeah, absolutely. -
unfortunately seems nervous system skewed toward creating one-trial
memories negative events. - Right. - survival adaptive mechanism.
neural connection allows happen? amygdala
hippocampus connection? mean, know, seems like every brain area
ultimately connected everything else. just question many
nodes, just like every city connected another city, just question many
flights roads traverse get there. one-trial
learning? mean, kind top contour level, can learn certain things fast
things tricky? now every time look white mug, queuing
something special simply virtue saying it. one-trial memory?
emotionally salient events allow memories get stamped in? - Yeah,


mean, think already alluded it. protective function
brains evolved last 2.5 million years need pay attention
remember certain things survival. things get stamped in,
memories, fear memories. get mugged subway or, know,
terrible things happen subway just learned. something
terrible happens, something scary happens, remember that, fear
memory things, mean, one lived Washington, DC,
went work NIH Sunday afternoon came back rounded
corner door apartment, crowbarred in. Somebody taken
crowbar, opened door, stole nicest things apartment,
wasn't nice, 'cause wasn't making much money. ever since then,
whenever rounded corner, still memory. terrible put
terrible state just coming home survival mechanism.
want alert possible danger? Absolutely yes. part one-trial memories,
think, often taking advantage evolutionarily developed system tamp
things potentially dangerous memory. forever will
remember particular corner

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work
memory neural circuitry, got learn today, well.

stored hippocampus? think tricky question. yes, coming
lot people debating people think shouldn't think
hippocampus storage area, think long, long, long-term kind
intermediate storage area, maybe not long-term storage area. hard
answer question. - Great, recall, HM remember facts
surgery. - Yes. - couldn't form new memories. - Correct. - given no
hippocampus, least partially support idea memories
retained outside hippocampus. - However, part posterior
hippocampus intact. tricky thing. think initially, fact, Scoville,
neurosurgeon overestimated number millimeters intended remove
hippocampus. this, historic MRI HM later life,
showed that, fact, part posterior hippocampus intact.
now makes little bit complicated interpret going on. Not
never uncomplicated, interpretation lesion patient, know,
complicated, HM mythical role neuroscience neurology now
complicated

00:18:48 One-Trial Memory

hippocampus intact. - Got it, not know that. memories
can formed quickly, called one-trial learning, just looking
list again, novelty, repetition, association, emotional resonance. seems like
experiences can bypass need multiple repetitions. - Yeah, absolutely. -
unfortunately seems nervous system skewed toward creating one-trial
memories negative events. - Right. - survival adaptive mechanism.
neural connection allows happen? amygdala
hippocampus connection? mean, know, seems like every brain area
ultimately connected everything else. just question many
nodes, just like every city connected another city, just question many
flights roads traverse get there. one-trial
learning? mean, kind top contour level, can learn certain things fast
things tricky? now every time look white mug, queuing
something special simply virtue saying it. one-trial memory?
emotionally salient events allow memories get stamped in? - Yeah,


mean, think already alluded it. protective function
brains evolved last 2.5 million years need pay attention
remember certain things survival. things get stamped in,
memories, fear memories. get mugged subway or, know,
terrible things happen subway just learned. something
terrible happens, something scary happens, remember that, fear
memory things, mean, one lived Washington, DC,
went work NIH Sunday afternoon came back rounded
corner door apartment, crowbarred in. Somebody taken
crowbar, opened door, stole nicest things apartment,
wasn't nice, 'cause wasn't making much money. ever since then,
whenever rounded corner, still memory. terrible put
terrible state just coming home survival mechanism.
want alert possible danger? Absolutely yes. part one-trial memories,
think, often taking advantage evolutionarily developed system tamp
things potentially dangerous memory. forever will
remember particular corner

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work
memory neural circuitry, got learn today, well.

00:21:56 Tool: Foundational Habits Enhance Brain Performance

hallway something really bad happened you. - seems
like location. talk conditioned place aversion, just geek speak
wanting avoid place something bad happened, conditioned place
preference, wanting go back place something positive happened. even
looking photograph wonderful time somebody can
evoke sorts positive sensations. seems like level, complex
brain is, basic elements feeling good feeling lousy states within brain
body linking places seems like pretty straightforward formula,
know, link place state, link state place, etc., description just provided.
learn complex information, poem, concept, ratchet
set ideas, also involves memory. sure talk this,
way aware state, bodily state can leveraged enhance
speed quality memories memory formation? clear it,
seems something important fourth, emotional resonance


component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work
memory neural circuitry, got learn today, well.

component. Novelty, crowbar doors, thank goodness sounds like
novel, wasn't repeated thing, thank goodness. repetition association
very, strong. people trying learn information not excited
about, repetition hard, novelty simply painful. - Yes,
there, absolutely. - Yeah, I. something can leverage
knowledge memory system works naturally make
straightforward process? - So, immediately turn things studied
talk beautifully podcast, strategies generally make
brain work better. just reminding podcast cold use
every morning. - Oh, cold? - do, do. - Just take moment and, just tell
us, cold exposure protocol, take back saying. -
cold exposure protocol end every morning shower take,
shower warm, give big blast cold end makes
feel good. several years, much less painful.
Okay, admit, really painful beginning, much less painful.
handle cold water pipes give nice, really cold water. just, feel
awakedness kind come that. miss it, forget it,
sometimes run back give cold blast upping, think
talked podcast, happening brain? - Basically cold
stimulus, shock, catching breath, etc., adrenaline adrenals.
also understand now, new neuroimaging, epinephrine
norepinephrine released locus ceruleus, brain structure back
brain, kind sprinklers rest brain kind wake-up chemical.
long arc dopamine release. paper back 2000 showed
steady increase 2.5x circulating dopamine. weren't looking
directly brain admittedly, goes four five hours. - Wow, yeah. -
improved mood feeling alertness real thing. - Yeah, yeah, use that.
mean, basically use morning routine. morning routine? get up,
45-minute tea meditation. meditating brewing drinking tea
learned monk institute Taiwan teaches tea meditation,
love it. learned tea, different kinds tea. 30-minute cardio
weights workout. take shower hot-cold contrast. And, oh,
that, key thing, want learn something want able get difficulty
repeating things, just push stuff, sleep, good, good sleep.


learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university

learned pandemic, sleep experiments learned
sleeping hour less really needed. really need seven-and-a-half
eight hours sleep. getting six half. now, get seven-and-
a-half eight hours every single night, guess what? come different difficult
tasks willing give try, try longer, try harder, brain
works better. think probably go back podcasts, learn
exactly one things do, bet probably do,
too, helping brain. - guarantee are. impressed
things, although not surprised. say extra hour sleep really
impressive extremely beneficial. curious, get early part
night going bed earlier? - Yeah. - Terrific, just mention, 'cause
humble it, say not full professor, tenured full
professor running laboratory, teach undergraduates, important
role public education, multiple books, now dean College Arts
Sciences NYU. extra hour sleep benefiting consequence
benefiting everybody else well. Thanks sharing us protocol. took off
trajectory one can do, think people appreciate knowing kind
practical steps are. knowing science important, mechanism
believe important embedding protocols people's minds might want
them, really hearing mechanics useful. sounds like everything
together takes hour, not excessive amount time, probably gives
outsized positive effect day. - Absolutely, definitely notice not
able it. don't, seven days week, also not just five days,
seven days week. can't it, usually early-morning flights things like
that. get it, critical working brain. - love just
highlight one thing said move on, said
sometimes get shower cold, get back in. That's, me,
really beautiful example conditioned place preference. Now cold shower
become something sort look forward to. say nobody immune
adrenaline increase cold, no matter cold, interesting
cold. one reasons important part screening special
operations, SEAL teams, branches military too,
stimuli can give anyone consistently get adrenaline - Oh,
interesting. - Release without harming them. heat, eventually need


use much heat damage tissue. exercise, use much
exercise can damage joints. kind brilliant, don't know
intentional not, sort unintentional genius special operations figured
sending people back cold over, never really gets easier,
time people actually start crave provides reduction
inflammation, etc. anyway, beautiful practice, thank you. want learn
tea meditation later episode.

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure

Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university

00:30:39 Exercise & Improved Memory, Making “Big, Fat, Fluffy Hippocampus”

event returning ways can improve memory formation. Maybe
tell us story around this. know told before, think lot
members audience love hear came this.
growing neuroscience, knew one the, say one three
four, alongside one another, isn't hierarchical statement, three
four top memory researchers world. Textbook material Suzuki. textbooks
filled word Suzuki, last name, according information memory
memory formation. things academics do,
still that, still high level, things took different
direction. maybe talk story came place
now think provides number tools people implement
themselves. - Yeah, story happened working get tenure NYU. And,
know, stress-filled process. give six years show stuff
judged front colleagues. either say, okay, can join
club say, sorry, humiliated front everybody.
going life. - actually tell people leave. don't get tenure,
gone. - leave institution. so, work really, really hard.
strategy was, just going not anything work just going work.
going just work hard can six years. happens
work don't sort life outside work live New York
sorts really good takeout, gain 25 pounds, exactly
did. get really, really stressed. start ask come living
New York City, love Broadway, haven't gone Broadway show two
years? I, 25 pounds overweight, decided go vacation. went


'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -

kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work
memory neural circuitry, got learn today, well.

'cause no friends. went to, adventure river rafting trip Peru.
go meet interesting people weakest person
whole trip. Like much better shape, embarrassing
won't say this, won't admit me, true. kind came back
said, okay, cannot weakest person. late 30s, something.
went gym said, oh God, 25 pounds overweight, try least
lose weight. go gym, notice much better feel go
just single class. remember first class went hip hop dance class.
terrible hip hop dancer, still felt good class. fast forward
year half, lost 25 pounds, proud myself, much happier.
sitting office lot, writing NIH grant,
lifeblood. writing, writing, writing, thought goes mind
never gone mind six years frantic grant writing
trying get tenure, thought grant writing went well today.
know, felt good. like, never thought before, going here,
really weird? - don't know anyone thought before. - No, sure
people thought. thought maybe just good day.
thought it, thought not just today. grant writing seems
getting smoother, like able focus longer, sessions feel better me.
point, thing changed life, huge thing, become
gym rat rather workaholic. spidey sense neuroscientists
popped said, know effects exercise brain?
think it, better writing focus longer
deeper, important, remember little details try pull
together million dollar NIH grant 30 different articles open
screen time, hippocampal memory. studying that,
writing grant hippocampal memory. got really interested
effects exercise prefrontal focus attention function
hippocampal function observation. still remember
sitting, office in, revelation. thing really sealed
me, made think not just, oh, interesting, want study this, right
around time got phone call mom said dad wasn't feeling
well told got lost driving back 7-11,
literally seven blocks house grew in. knew hippocampal


function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work

function. suspected dementia. suspected, oh, didn't want admit Alzheimer's
dementia, had. funny because, mean wasn't funny, mom
dad two sides different coin. dad engineer, not active
life, loved sit read books day. mom athlete.
played team tennis 80s. started show point.
even pressing reason think effects exercise
noticed things improving brain suddenly went away
dad's brain. Really, really smart guy, engineer Silicon Valley, helped push
Silicon Valley '70s happen, no memory. couldn't focus
attention. mood rock bottom, happy guy. everything
opposite me. started thinking isn't just something help somebody
wants get tenure, something help millions millions people,
importantly, aging population. if, know, happening?
thing makes wake morning realized every single time
move body, releasing whole bunch neurochemicals.
talked about, good mood comes dopamine, serotonin,
noradrenaline, thing gets released also, particularly aerobic exercise,
growth factor called brain derived neurotrophic factor, BDNF.
important goes directly hippocampus helps
brand new brain cells grow hippocampus. that. Even
couch potato, can get new brain cells hippocampus grow. like
giving hippocampus boost regular BDNF, exercising.
means capacity grow bigger, fatter, fluffier hippocampus.
like give people image every single time move body,
like giving brain wonderful bubble bath neurochemicals, going on,
need bubble bath noradrenaline, dopamine, serotonin, growth
factors. regular bubble baths, doing? growing big fat, fluffy
hippocampus. not going cure father's dementia, Alzheimer's dementia,
know what? go 70s big fat, fluffy hippocampus, even
genes starts kick in, going take longer disease start affect
ability form retain new long-term memories

00:39:35 Cardiovascular Exercise, BDNF (Brain-Derived Neurotrophic Factor)



facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure

Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university

facts events, motivation getting 30 45
minutes aerobic exercise every day. - Fantastic. Quick question protocol
just because. discuss mechanistic things related signals
body might sending brain little bit detail BDNF circuitry.
30 45 minutes of, sounds like cardiovascular exercise might special.
say think literature aware mice monkeys,
certainly humans, looking effects exercise brain function typically
outcome improvement, almost always. don't think ever seen paper showing
animals humans exercise more, brain gets worse. just can't think
single paper. doesn't mean doesn't exist. sure someone will put one
comment section. find one, thank can find that,
seems like always cardiovascular exercise experimentally lab lot easier
get mouse run treadmill get mouse lift weights. Although
people put little ankle weights mice ways getting mice
resistance work actually little bit barbaric - Little stressful. - 'Cause oftentimes
incapacitate limb overload another limb, asymmetric thing. not
sending squats, deadlifts, something. cardiovascular
exercise might special. thoughts that? please first, though,
tell us routine. routine 30 45 minutes of, Peloton cycler?
matter? - think data suggests long heart rate getting
long-term effects hippocampus prefrontal cortex, also get better
shifting focusing attention, need cardiovascular. use
video workout started even pandemic, called "Daily Burn,"
just thousands different workouts. love 30 minutes sometimes add
10 15 minute stretch beginning end. love variety.
Sometimes weight. Sometimes without weights. love kickboxing,
lot kickboxing there. just fits routine, always there,
don't get dressed go gym work out. do. -
daily thing, seven days week? - Yeah, yeah. - Seven days week, fantastic.
terms way changes conveyed body
brain, fascinates me. mean, know, sort repeating
record podcast always saying, got brain also spinal cord
nervous system connects everything. Every organ body
basically signaled nervous system back nervous system,


explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much

explaining everything. imagine morning routine,
cardiovascular exercise, pumping blood, definition higher
heart rate, stroke volume heart goes time, getting fitter, blood
flow brain increasing. know gets translated signal
release BDNF? raises question, is, matter
mind exercise? ultimately brain, course, can
anchor attention exercise can listening podcast something
else. always wondered this. Can enhance effects exercise
combining enhanced blood flow cognitive work exercise? simply
matter just getting blood flow hippocampus? - Yeah, wish
answer question, too. instinct is, yes, matters partially work
colleague, Alia Crum, mindset power change
physiologically body responding. not work experiments
work experiments not work morning morning exercise routine.
studies, point study, don't know one. exercise neuroscientists
there, love see study done. yes, works. go aerobic
thing, always like start least amount exercise get something really
useful, don't want people say, oh God, hate sweating, don't want listen
anymore. always like start studies shown just 10 minutes
walking outside can shift mood. part neurochemical bubble bath
getting dopamine, serotonin, noradrenaline anybody can walk 10 minutes.
thinking there, minimum get
brain effects? 10 minutes walking, anybody can it. - Now outside
important? big believer getting photons eyes. - think study
done indoors treadmill. comparison wasn't done, moving your,
great, middle pandemic walked around apartment 30 minutes
sometimes just variety, felt like rat running wheel, yes.
minimum amount movement body can get mood effects.
big, fat, fluffy hippocampus? better performing prefrontal
cortex? start need cardio workout. reading
literature, haven't enough studies directly comparing contrasting
kickboxing running, whatever cardio need do, cardio
workout done positive effects. going say interpretation
whatever way get heart rate up, including power walk, power


walk can get heart rate up, beneficial. happening, two
pathways studied go moving body
BDNF, neurotrophin increasing growth new hippocampal brain cells.
two pathways following. One myokine, protein released
muscles. not heart, striated muscles body.
running, studies done rats running wheels, showed
running rats myokine, released myokine past blood-brain
barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation

barrier. got rarefied, protected bloodstream inside brain,
myokine stimulated release BDNF brain, pathway number one.
Pathway number two comes liver exercise stress generally.
know that, well, cortisol released whenever exercise. need
sugar blood physiological mechanisms work.
ketone, beta-hydroxybutyrate, known long time gets released
liver exercise. also know particular ketone passes
blood-brain barrier. another stimulant BDNF. kind final common
pathway seems BDNF stimulation hippocampus. one, probably
not, one studied clearly. comes
physiological systems, muscles working, liver responding stress
exercise, doing, giving BDNF precursors get brain,
cause upspike BDNF, part bubble bath getting every
time move. - love description factor muscle factor liver,
anytime thinking movement body translating
brain, clearly pointed out, needs traverse blood-brain barrier. Not
everything happens body communicated brain seem like
really important signals. Beta-hydroxybutyrate, mentioned ketone, just want
underscore doesn't mean, folks, need ketogenic diet. think
people hear ketone think, know people are, people not,
imagine. ketones released brain

00:48:48 Neurogenesis (New Neuron Production) Adults

body can function, even ingesting carbohydrates not ketogenic,
just point clarification. issue new neurons one hear lot,
know, neurogenesis, going grow new neurons, new neurons.


understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university

understanding rodent literature clear animals run wheels
often, turns rodents love run wheels. know studies
Hoppy Holster, pretty funny, cool, way, Hoppy, Howard
Hughes investigator, not making light them. put running wheels field
wild rodents will run running wheel run running wheel. - Oh,
great. - really enjoy it. find amusing reasons probably
neuroscientist find amusing. case, rodents, seems running
wheel can trigger neurogenesis, literally birth new neurons addition
new neurons hippocampus. monkeys, controversial. seems
happen hippocampus olfactory bulb, probably not
neocortex. Thinking back decades controversy Liz Gould
Pasko Rakic. hope settled differences there. Neuroscientists love argue.
kind do. humans, think bit controversial. people
say absolutely, yes. people say absolutely no, new neurons added
adult brain. haven't followed literature detail. remember one
study don't think contested, work Rusty Gage Salk Institute
actually injected sort due type marker brains terminally ill
humans graciously offered brains removed dissected
death. cases, old terminally ill humans, see evidence
new neurons born hippocampus. Can trust idea still?
generally accepted? - Well, study, quite ago,
recent studies, still controversial, showing demonstrating, using even new
better techniques used original Rusty Gage study,
groundbreaking time, suggest, think show, new neurons
born adult human brains ninth decade life. not this, think
patients 60s, died cancer. new studies looking
across timeline, can see, thing was, yeah, maybe
20, time older might need new
neurons, no new neuron growth.

00:51:50 Effects Exercise Memory

studies seem suggest that, yes, yes do. even old
age. - Great, just take moment say personally not aware


studies looking forms exercise besides cardiovascular exercise sake
brain health. this, think, important gap literature filled,
whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much

whether not instance, high intensity interval training, whether not weight
training, effects musculature, can imagine perhaps
myokine BDNF pathway, pathway one mentioned, might signaled,
maybe not liver pathway, maybe. Yes, speculating here. studies need
done. knowledge, just haven't done yet. done.
would, tell us specific effects exercise
memory? Memory broad category effects phenomena. things like
comes mind short-term, medium- long-term memory, reaction time, learning
math, least me, quite bit different learning history, although
certainly overlap neural underpinnings. demonstrated
laboratory animal models, especially humans, want share us
results lab, published unpublished, sure audience
delighted learn them. - Absolutely, let start kind immediate
effects, acute effects called, exercise brain. asking
one-off exercise session brain? there, three major
effects reproduced. seen lab, many labs reproduced
this. get one-off? usually aerobic-type exercise
session, 30 45 minutes. get mood boost, very, consistent.
get improved prefrontal function, typically tested Stroop test, test
asks shift focus attention specific ways. challenging task
clearly dependent prefrontal cortex largely. significant improvements
reaction time, speed responding, often motor kind of, cognitive motor
response improved. pandemic, one unpublished studies
looking effects 30 minutes age-appropriate workout subjects ranging
age 20s way 90s. things saw
consistently? Irrespective age, everybody got decreased anxiety
depression hostility score, important. not just decreasing
anxiety depression decreasing hostility levels. - Making world better
place. - Making world better place. Energy, feeling energy went up.
found older population, even younger population,
saw improved performance Stroop Eriksen flanker task, another
task dependent really focusing different letters paying attention


letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos
exercise period.

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure

out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much

letter shown. consistent effects. long last? One
studies publish lab showed immediate effects exercise lasted
two hours. Unfortunately, longest last, still
two hours. pretty big bang buck. - is. - One 30 minute. - Sorry
interrupt, just want make sure understand. say effects lasted
two hours, mean two hours finished exercise? two
hours memory challenging work? Just clear. - Yeah, great question.
study looked two hours finish workout gave cognitive
tests. two-hour period, free anything except exercise eat.
no extra load people. two hours later, significantly
better focused attention tasks compared group watched videos

00:56:31 Tool: Timing Daily Exercise, Cortisol

hour cycling did. young subjects 20s. -
Okay, finish exercise 9:00 AM, even start cognitive work, mental
work 11, still see benefits. - Yes, least 11, didn't go farther two
hours. last even longer that, evidence lasts two
hours. - perhaps started cognitive work 45 minutes exercise
ended, also helpful. - Yes. - no reason think a,
wait starting cognitive work. - Yeah, no reason all. - asking
questions sort get comments, going get comment
section. always strive clarity here. tells exercising early
day may special effect. realize people cannot exercise later
evening, mentioned something earlier want cue people to,
very, important. don't think ever mentioned podcast,
kind physical activity will increase cortisol varying degrees. sometimes
healthy increase, sometimes unhealthy increase. two hours really
intense exercise not prepared it, big spike cortisol, probably not
good thing people. going cardiovascular weight
training later day, increase cortisol can promote much wakefulness
sleep, etc. Shifting cortisol spike early day associated number
important things related mood, etc. more, thinking hearing


exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work
memory neural circuitry, got learn today, well.

exercise early day key. former dean medical school, Phil
Pizzo, kind famous still jogging hours of, like, 4 5:00
AM, five six, running medical school. early
exercise, cold shower, meditation, talk meditation,
push, feel like, stimulus us think moving exercise
earlier day. - Yeah, mean, like say that, know moms dads
just say, look, kid, kid's important
exercise. will get benefits whenever can. great,
power you. neuroscience data suggests best time
exercise right need use brain important way
need use every day. morning us beneficial.
morning lucky enough able that. yeah,
makes sense all, everything know works benefits
brain. - think colleague, Eric Kandel, not incidentally Nobel Prize
studies memory. rumor swimmer lot years.
put in, think nowadays '90s, now put half mile, used
swim mile day something sort. - Wow, heard that, too,
swimmer very, religiously. - Okay,
neuroscientists that, can think lot neuroscientists probably
exercise more. don't say poke them, just love see
incredible work many decades.

01:00:02 Age-Related Memory Loss, Daily Exercise

everything talking today indicates one doesn't, unless
incredible genetics, experience age-related dementia, right. mean, story
father salient one. remember go forward. also
want emphasize, love get thoughts just memory memory loss
general. seems get worse remembering learning things, even don't
get Alzheimer's. typically start humans? - know, think
much variability, not individuals, stress levels
different and, well, everybody's anxiety level gone last couple years,
also effect. don't remember much highly stressful, highly
anxious situation. So, know, hard answer question. People say, okay,


just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much
coming today discussion share knowledge not just
existing data, new data coming soon, leadership university
system, leadership public education, decades important work
memory neural circuitry, got learn today, well.

just tell much exercise do. - 30 45 minutes day. love per
day, whole thing telling people, oh, data say 150 200
minutes zone two cardio, kind moderately hard not excessively hard,
love everyday theme. whenever that, questions come
back are, well, take long hike weekends? people start
negotiating. something powerful non-negotiable, everyday. Sun
eyes every day even cloud cover. Exercise 30 45 minutes. Cold
shower every day. - Every day, yeah. - understanding literature
somewhere 50s 60s, start noticing little hiccups memory, people
younger, people later. imagine exercise throughout
one's entire life going help offset simply 'cause BDNF
downstream effects. - Yeah, mean, suggests. One favorite studies,
want get back wanted, invited share
unpublished data effects long-term exercise, first want share one
favorite studies, longitudinal study done Swedish women.
published 2018. back 1960s, found Swedish
women, 300 Swedish women 40s. characterized low fit, mid fit,
high fit. Okay, 40 years later, came back found women, let
do, live lives. asked happened women function
whether low fit, mid fit, high fit 40s, now 80s.
found relative low fit mid fit women, women high fit
gained nine years good cognition later life. Now not randomized
controlled study. correlational study. agree everything
talking today? Yes, agree idea women
high fit giving brains bubble bath, maybe not every day, very,
regularly entire 40 years built big, fat, beautiful
hippocampi? Yes, does. one favorite studies. - Yeah, another cause
getting exercise consistently. impressed 10-minute walk
improvements mood just 10-minute walk. again, think daily repetition
also imagine effects pathways allow plasticity.
something we, realm neuroplasticity, don't often hear think about,
even neuroscientist, pathways engaging plasticity probably can
be, probably speculating here, can made better engaging sorts
behavior stimulate plasticity. words, one gets better calming


stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove

recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class

anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation

million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much

stress, circuits get better that. - Yes, absolutely. - Neural
circuits gain proficiency. so, blood vessels can grow, capillaries can grow
brain, can imagine pumping blood brain, delivery
various muscle liver factors also establish larger efficient portals
getting stuff there. imagine kind amplifying effect exercise,
again, speculating here, seen colleagues,
ones exercise consistently seem really, really smart amazing work
well 80s 90s ones aren't, actually pride
little exercise, get worse time. see
meeting, decade not poking fun all, actually quite, quite hard
see. kind fading light, starting flicker.
incredible relationship body vitality brain vitality. That, course, not
excuse spending day gym. gym rats, enjoy working
imagine that, doesn't make us smarter, unfortunately actually


01:05:33 Tool: Exercise Protocol Improving Cognition

cognitive work also, not just exercise. love hear
new unpublished data. - Yeah, okay, jumped exercise work,
everybody studying people 65 older cognitive decline
begins. idea exercise can help cognition, makes sense.
However, thought, well, know great, lots work there. wanted
know happens people 40s 50s, maybe even 30s
20s. Why, we, humans able, ready, willing, able
increase exercise gets us set build brains go 60s.
first study looked low fit participants 30s mid 50s,
wanted ask question, much exercise really need start seeing
benefits? see benefits? maybe wait start seeing
cognitive decline get benefits. one theories there.
wanted do. three months two three times week
cardio, spin class, spin classes great cardio. comparison
group two three times week competitive video Scrabble. no heart rate
change, come lab group just like


group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling

okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets

group spin class. touched cognitively beginning end
session. found two three times week cardio people,
low fit, means specifically exercising less 30 minutes
week three months previous experiment. went two
three times week spin class found changes baseline rates
positive mood states went relative video Scrabble group. body
image got positive exercising, great. really
important, motivation exercise went significantly compared video
Scrabble group, great. exercise, motivated
exercise. cognition? changed cognitive circuits brain?
Number one, got improved performance Stroop task, headed
towards favorite structure, hippocampus. found improved
performance recognition memory task, memory coding task,
is, can differentiate similar items asking remember,
spatial episodic memory task, play one Doom like games
went spatial maze things virtual city.
performance got better, very, classically dependent
hippocampus. this, satisfying study wanting
answer question, minimum amount doable amount exercise will
get cognitive benefits? now can say 30-to-50-year olds low fit,
two three times week. doable, absolutely. Will hard low fit, yeah,
going challenging, absolutely doable. makes sense
mechanisms are, didn't study mechanisms just clear,
mechanisms imagining playing role here, absolutely makes sense
doable. not like become marathon runner get
benefits. start moving body regular basis two three times
week. love realness. - long sessions again? - 45
Minutes. - 45 Minutes. - Yeah, 45 minutes, typical spin kind class.
warmup five minutes cool five minutes, really 35 minutes
really pushing you. - breathing reasonably hard. Heart rate up. -
Heart rate definitely up, yeah - find results really interesting
results showing improvement motivation exercise interesting, 'cause
gets back issue kind self-amplifying effect. neuroscientist
wants think kind pre-motor circuits fact motor system


can obviously things like lift cups, walk, run want need to,
possible create kind anticipatory activity nervous system
body craves certain stimulus, mentioned cold crave cold.
Now whether not adrenaline, dopamine, etc., whether not
somebody exercises, going zero, less 30 minutes per week two
three times week, 45 minutes, described study. experience
cardio, tend battle most, love lifting heavy objects, least
heavy me. happy go gym every day just lift heavy objects
hour. just makes happy, like way feels, since
teens, 30 years. Cardio's little bit trickier. like run, stop running
little find hard get back into. start running three times week
30 45 minutes pretty consistently days don't weight train, find
start crave it. almost body needs order to, always say, clear
cobwebs, like mind doesn't function well, clearly now understand
exercise helps, also physically almost feel like body needs
engage movement. Like pre-motor circuits kind revving, kind like
revving engine car park. motivation exercise obviously

01:12:17 Anticipating Exercise, Daily Habits & Behaviors

multifaceted. purely psychological, think
reason speculate least believe can build anticipatory, reverbatory
activity nervous system? - Yeah, yeah, agree also
kinds thoughts anticipatory exercise can't it.
just got back week half Paris, got book launch last
book, "Good Anxiety." really walked around lot, not exercise
whole week half. lot stress 'cause
interviews French. gave break. - speak French? - speak French. -
going say, otherwise really stressful. - really stressful. -
really impressed. definitely start exercising. Actually,
follow morning routine T, okay, impressive nonetheless. - got
back coming back direction Paris, live New York, much easier.
able get normal time next day. exercise session first
day like, okay, back home, back environment. felt good.


like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets
habit saying good things yourself. start realize, oh God,
mean myself. lots negative thoughts going
head, part reason loved this, particular form
exercise. get IntenSati mood boost positive spoken
affirmations together brain affect boosts talking
whole podcast, exercise, sweaty workout well. -
Interesting, book, confess haven't read it, pleasure
discussion psychologist from, believe University Michigan
Ann Arbor, Ethan Kross wrote book called "Chatter," focuses fact
much inner dialogue, indeed negative. certainly wasn't first point
out. explicit statements counter negative chatter, believe one
hallmarks readjusting one's own, not just internal reference frame, actually self-
image generally. fascinating and, think, important area psychology
neuroscience because, acknowledge this, talking this, two
laboratory neuroscientists record neurons label neurons look stuff


microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day

multifaceted. purely psychological, think

able get normal time next day. exercise session first

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream

01:32:27 Meditation Works, Focusing Present

exercise think much evidence, know much evidence
meditation beneficial. think working think doing? -
Yeah, think one important things gets worked


simple 10 minute 12 minute body scan meditation regularly, 10 minutes day, 12
minutes day habit building practice focusing present moment.
think hard us modern humans do, worrying thing
due end week need many hours going
able that. worried about, whatever, email wasn't polite
sent repercussions instead focusing
moment, fun, get talk you, beautiful day outside, feeling
good right moment. think those, meditative practices
done, one also, whether know not, getting focus
moment. think even important day age anxiety levels
next variant might come repercussions there?
mother older susceptible it, war, going
happen there? future possibilities. worried that.
possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,
including just good basic brain function. critical get information,
basic neuroscience information heads students trying
best show us brains work, hampered not moving
enough, not meditating. distracting things include
lives. little bit good, know, 24 hours day
phone linked in, not LinkedIn, linked phone damaging
attention. exercise, meditation, sleep can help learn, retain, perform better
not three things life. - Wonderful, music ears.
also either low cost zero cost, considering exercise doesn't require
class, one use freely available resource gravity jumping jacks,
burpees, pushups, whatever, sit ups, combination. - don't
forget YouTube, freely accessible millions YouTube videos. don't want
jumping jacks yourself, always say this, talk breath meditation
book, "Good Anxiety," don't like one suggest
million YouTube ratings one star five stars, use resource. -
wonderful resource amazing resource. Wendy, thank much

like wanted come back. know worked years, now
truthfully say seven days week, first four five, five
six, yeah, seven, includes yoga day, sometimes 10
minutes instead 30 leave. habit even five
minutes, either weight 10-minute thing, five-minute thing, stretch,
tiny habit. somebody Stanford invented idea tiny habits,
thought was? - Well, got number people there. apologize advance
people neglect statement, happy put comments, folks.
BJ Fogg there, done-- - Yes, I, - BJ's done really great work.
James Clear wrote book habits popular newsletter habits.
done episode habits covers work
laboratory-ish, not ish, laboratory science, peer-reviewed work it. Daily
behaviors, also daily behaviors performed roughly time day. mean, one
thing know sure circadian system part nervous system's way
anticipating things will happen, not just will happen. telling things
obviously know already, audience. Performing exercise roughly
time day will make easier opposed just saying, going
seven days week sometime today. course, getting done sometime better
not getting done. - Yes, absolutely, absolutely. - Well, impressive
effects love starting look populations bit younger, not
older populations aren't important, think building good
habits across one's entire life really about. always say anything
related longevity offsetting age-related decline, don't know, hard know
things work no within subject control. also know sure
don't want control experiment. - Exactly. - absolutely don't want
control experiment, especially something purely behavioral. mean,
not talking ingesting particular supplement. not talking
changing diet way. curious diet barbed wire topic
internet, diets whether not work, etc., general,
studies, evaluate whether not people change eating habits
start exercise more? - Yeah, think seen one study controlled that,
feel hard enough get people exercise level
time, need study. also ask them, okay, fill survey tell us
exactly ate day, going say, forget you, not joining study.


critical question. again, one seen
evidence diets got better they, know, less processed foods,

01:17:09 “Every Drop Sweat Counts” – Exercise & Cognitive Function

adhere exercise. lot information needs gathered
realm. second study wanted share unpublished, writing right
now, part two study just described, low fit people. Next
move mid fit people, like us, already exercising, going benefit
increasing exercise? collaborated great spin studio
whole bunch mid fit people definition exercising two three
times week regular basis. great, people
that, know already benefiting brain. question
invited exercise much wanted spin studio three months,
two three times way seven times week, just see
happened. control group, asked not change exercise.
ended nice big array starting mid fit people exercise
staying two three times week, way seven times week.
bottom line study every drop sweat counted. is,
change increase workout seven times week, better mood
was, lower amounts depression anxiety, higher amounts good effect,
better hippocampal memory worked out, again,
three months. love too, gives power us
regularly exercising wondering, really need to? mean, really going help
me? answer yes. mean, not us can exercise, go spin class seven
times week, love message body responsive that. can
get better hippocampal function, better overall baseline mood affect higher level.
works mid fit people well. - Fantastic, learn you,
starting conceptualize brain organ privileged many ways,
unique blood-brain barrier, incredible quality able predict
things, job mainly is, course, predict things among functions,
course, brain isn't necessarily going stay stable get better time,
needs signal. isn't sufficient just say can't take granted,
brain actually organ requires signal order maintain function


sounds like enhanced blood flow pathways described earlier,
two pathways least among critical signals. tempted now move
frequency cardiovascular exercise from, confess three days, 35 minutes
lately, daily. something really, again, really special
daily nonnegotiable, just it. sounds like one
higher intensity exercise, know spin class, never taken spin class,
seen times standing bike pedaling hard.
included kinds workouts, right? - Absolutely, yeah. - Okay. - mean,
instructor doing. cannot control. monitor heart rate
subjects clearly, compared video Scrabble, highly significant.

01:20:58 Positive Affirmations & Mood

- hope so. - Yes. - guess depends intense game Scrabble is.
just briefly talk mindset affirmations? - Yeah, sure. - talked
bit affirmations, mentioned, beautiful work colleague
Stanford, Alia Crum, can summarize work pretty simply, although won't
complete justice it, already podcast, just say one's beliefs
behavior also impact outcomes behavior. learn lot true
facts stress good you, experience stress better
focus learn negative effects stress. learn
positive effects exercise, actually derive greater benefit exercise, believe
not. incredible, incredible effects, make sense understand
brain doing, lot predictive coding mindsets don't seem
mysterious woo anymore understand brain really doing.
is, any, value affirmation telling something positive
yourself, exercise, not exercise itself, mood, self image, memory,
brain function? - Yeah, so, looked also certified exercise
instructor form exercise teach called IntenSati. form exercise
developed amazing instructor, Patricia Moreno. combined
physical movements kickbox, dance, yoga, martial arts positive
spoken affirmations. move, punching back forth,
kickbox class, don't just punch, say something like strong now,
every punch associated word. know, can create series


affirmations moves put together. first time it, just
wandered class, didn't know felt idiotic, like what,
came wrong class, don't want come class. saw didn't
care whether thought looked silly saying affir-, not saying, yelling
affirmations loud choreography time. tried it,
okay, didn't yell out, kind whispered first. end, really yelling
out. something declaration, using voice saying things
don't often say yourself, like strong, inspired, believe will succeed,
kinds affirmations say. walk class, walked
class, thinking, ah, feel really good now. Man, can't wait come back
class. ultimately took teacher training able teach class.
started look known affirmations never
combined physical activity, clear literature showing
positive affirmations, saying reading change mood way
talking about, know, Alia Crum's work. this, belief,
start saying things, not difficult things believe, amazing
much don't say kinds things voice.
might say somebody else, oh, strong, smart. say
yourself? thing self affirmations. really gets

household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked

lot attention, not disparaging, think people done

possibility, need plan that. also need focus moment
right now. healthy, can breathe, get interesting conversation right
moment. start thinking things, takes away moment.
know circuits involved? Not exactly, not area. think
studies focused that, present moment kind activity.
think important practice meditation one important
things calms us down. know that, gives
powerful tool rest day. not locked fearful future thinking
many us have, just reliving terrible past, enjoy
present moment. - Yeah, really resonates. think going back earlier part
conversation, hippocampus incredible storage capacity ability
set context past, present, future. beautiful thing much
like think semblance healthy life, none us want HM, none
us want position not able form new memories no
context past present. grateful that, grateful
hippocampus can draw past, present, future various combinations
support daily exercise habits, call habits,
people make habits now highlighted. not deliberately
anchoring within past, present, future according need, just
shuffling past, present, future, not good way live. - No. - not
effective. - No. - sounds like meditation can really help us go right stacks.


guess people don't go libraries anymore, old days go right
location library, actually can't get distracted books interested
in, need go just reflexively, need go study particular topic.
kind think it. makes us linear perhaps way being. - think
so, actually counteracts, not technology, phones
connected every good bad thing going world today
incredibly distracting takes away present moment virtually 24 hours
day. work extra hard right now compared '40s
didn't technology level. yeah, becomes even
important practice, think, everyday life.

01:37:14 Tool: Strategies Increase Attention

- Yeah, even 10, 15 years ago felt like smartphones weren't intrusive. One final
question maybe request. new incoming dean College Letters
Sciences, must say delighted, thrilled actually hear lot practices
discussing today pioneered going incorporated
undergraduate education. predict, willing wager will become
template universities non-university systems function
indeed the, true, incredible relationship physical
movement mental deliberate practices performance, corporation, school,
household crazy, self-limiting, even self-destructive not
incorporate those. happy going collect data. Please,
touch back hear comes that. one main
things hear much today issues attention. haven't talked
attention, mainly talking memory cognition. know
lot attention, not disparaging, think people done
say consequence need lack resources.
immense amount Adderall use, Ritalin use, Modafinil use, caffeine abuse. Now,
happen like caffeine, don't use compounds described, just
incredible data are, colleague mine Stanford claims
something like two-thirds college students use without prescription
ADHD. can expect terms effects regular exercise attention?
things besides exercise meditation like see


people terms trying increase powers attention? think
ability focus attend really distinguishing feature will
succeed endeavor won't. scary thing lot people
hear lot people think ADHD. may, may not.
bet number students Stanford NYU feel challenged holding
attention thing need hold attention to. - Yeah, say
top three tools everybody right minute today can use capacity
attend want include exercise reasons talked about.
direct effect functioning prefrontal cortex. Meditation also, clear clinical studies
showing improved ability focus particularly focus present moment.
third sleep. sleep is, can't, three,
physiological. mean, live whole life without meditating one minute.
survive without sleep? No, none us could. So, basic physiological,
important core cognitive functions, including attention, including creativity,

microscope, now deep territory, deep water
colleagues people think neuroscience consider really
kind subjective edges. yet think worth pointing brain
things. responsible simple reflexes motor behaviors, also
high-level conceptual ideas universe might look like 10 years,
100 years, 1,000 years, also high-level conceptual understanding
about. even though might seem little bit fringes,
dare say, think important untread landscapes
neuroscience. just want acknowledge appreciation fact going
connect dots say, went somebody didn't exercise,
went rafting trip, discovered exercise benefits grant writing
on, became certified

01:27:28 Meditation & Cognitive Performance

- Exercise instructor. - Instructor. don't anything halfway, either clear.
like touch something mentioned earlier, haven't dove
depth, meditation. mentioned tea meditation. publication
recently 10-minute meditation. - Yes. - Right? Maybe tell us
10-minute meditation seems like tractable amount time.
maybe tell us little bit tea meditation. sounds like
discovered minimum, close minimum threshold meditation can really
benefit us. maybe tell us study. - study was,
astutely pointed out, practical study, just 10 minutes, not 30 minutes, not hour
meditation, hard, 10 minutes guided meditation. logged site.
can tell logged listened a, body scan, basic, easy
follow kind meditation. asked it, often? Daily, seven days
week, just 10 minutes day. shocking thing study got
adherence 10 minute daily meditation 10 minute daily podcast
listening, control. highest retention rate ever gotten any,
kind study done, exercise meditation, wanted 10 minutes
day. great. - going just start leading meditations three hours opposed
three-hour podcast. - looked cognitive effects this,
eight weeks daily, actually 12-minute meditation, 12 minutes body scan


meditation. found significant decreases stress response.
stress test see responded unexpected, stressful situation.
meditators much better. mood better cognitive performance
also better. first little foray meditation started
personal tea meditation, really shifted relationship meditation.
consistent many studies showing beneficial effects meditation.
unique thing tried make doable many, many people
actually follow typical regimen, continuing that. fact, research
lab right now doable, short things NYU college students will do,
not just beginning semester, end semester stress
anxiety levels now record-breaking high levels. need something
bring level show professors brains can
actually do. includes short meditations, sound meditations, visual
meditations, walking, things college student, obviously focused
NYU students, will do. want get graduation rates. want get class
performance kinds interventions. started study just
described, meditation. - would, can highlight again,
highly educated speculation, coming you. think going
meditation? mean, body skin involves kind interoceptive awareness,
like interoception, course, attention going surface
within confines skin opposed outside world. Drawing attention
anything inside us outside us involves forebrain function, prefrontal cortex
presumably, things, typically eyes closed, typically relaxing.
lot variables feeding number different effects.
neuroscientist, think going period kind self-induced,
somewhat unusual state, think going terms network behavior
networks within brain can long-term effects? got
ones downstream
