year's supply vitamin D3. now, conversation Dr. Karl Deisseroth.
Well, thanks here. - Thanks me. - long time coming
me, may not know this, one reasons started podcast
actually conversation. [Karl laughs] one,
reasons, one goals able hold conversations colleagues mine
incredible work realm science, also
really special opportunity also clinician. see patients
long time. people might not familiar fields neuroscience, et
cetera, difference neurology psychiatry? - Well, married
neurologist psychiatrist make fun time. lot
neuroscientists lot brain clinicians actually think two
field point future, past, started together.
Psychiatry though, focuses disorders can't see something physically
wrong, don't measurable, no blood test makes
diagnosis, no brain scan tells us schizophrenia, depression
individual patient. psychiatry much mysterious, tools
words. Neurologists fantastic physicians. see stroke brain
scans, see seizure pre-seizure activity EEG, can
measure treat based measureables. psychiatry, harder job,
think. use words, rating scales symptoms, can measure depression
autism rating scales, words still. ultimately,
psychiatry built around. odd situation got complex,
beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered object universe, yet
words find way in. - So, find patient verbal hyper-
verbal, easier time diagnosing them, opposed somebody
quiet reserved? it's, imagine opposite might true well. -
Well, words, put finger key point. don't
speak much, principle, harder. lack speech can symptom. can
see depression, can see negative symptoms schizophrenia,
can see autism. Sometimes itself, symptom, reduced speech,
ultimately need something. need words help guide fact,
challenges can tell patients depression
depressed, can't speak. makes bit challenge distinguish depression


reasons might not speaking. sort art
science psychiatry. - find patients have, well,
call comorbidities conditions land psychiatry
neurology, meaning damage particular area brain therefore
depressed? tease psychiatrist? - Yeah,
happens time. Parkinson's disease great example. can debilitating
many ways. People trouble moving, trouble walking, trouble
swallowing, can truly severe depression. might
say, "Oh, well, got life-threatening illness", plenty neurological
disorders depression not strongly comorbid symptom, like ALS, Lou Gehrig's
disease, example, depression not strongly comorbid disease,
Parkinson's, extremely common. know, Parkinson's disease,
loss dopamine neurons midbrain. specific population
cells dying, probably leads movement disorder
depression. many examples two fields come together
really need work team. patients clinic, treat
depression associated Parkinson's,

00:12:19 Blood Tests Mental Disease

neurologist treats movement associated Parkinson's work
together. - think will ever blood test depression schizophrenia
autism? good bad thing? - think ultimately will
quantitative tests. Already, efforts made look certain rhythms brain
using external EEGs look brain waves effectively, look ratios certain
frequencies frequencies, progress made front.
not good be. doesn't really give confidence individual

measureables point. Now, good bad? think will
good, one challenges psychiatry art well
science elicit symptoms precise way. take time,
great just quick measurements. abused misused?



00:13:38 Largest Challenges Facing Treatment Mental Health

Certainly. think true, medicine. - want know, sure
several, see biggest challenge facing psychiatry
treatment mental illness today? - think making progress biggest
challenge is, think still strong stigma psychiatric disease
patients often don't come us, feel able handle
own. can slow treatment. can lead worsening symptoms. know,
example, patients untreated anxiety issues. go year
serious untreated anxiety issue, can convert depression. can add
another problem top anxiety. be... people not come
treatment? feel like something able master own,
can true, usually, help good thing. - raises question
related something heard say many years ago lecture, that,
scientific lecture said, "We don't know people feel.
time, don't even really know feel." - [chuckles] Yeah. - [Andrew] Maybe
elaborate little bit dearth ways talk
feelings. mean, many words. don't know many, guessing
dozen words describe state call sadness, far
understand, don't way comparing real objective sense.
psychiatrist, job use words diagnose, words patient diagnose,
maneuver around that? landscape call feelings
emotions? - really interesting. tension words
built clinic mean something physicians,
colloquial use words may not same, first level
sort someone says, "I'm depressed", exactly mean that?
may different talking terms depression. part
psychiatry get beyond word, get actually feeling, get rid
jargon get real world examples feeling. So, much
look forward future? much hope have? much planning
future? now getting actual things can talk
unambiguous. someone says, "Yeah, can't even think tomorrow. don't
see going get tomorrow". nice, precise thing know,


sad, tragic, also, means something. know means.
hopelessness symptom depression. try
psychiatric interview. try get past jargon, get actually happening
patient's life mind. say, ultimately, [chuckles] shows
across... address issue every day life, whether lab
looking animals, whether fish mice rats studying behavior,
conversation just friend colleague, talking patient,
never really know going inside mind person. get
feedback, get words, get behaviors, get actions, never really know.
said beginning question, often don't even words
insight even understand going mind. think lot psychiatrists
pretty introspective. part reason end specialty, so,
maybe spend little time average person thinking going
within, doesn't mean answers. - area trying figure
going hood words, sounds like certain words
relate idea anticipation hope. fair say somehow relates
dopamine system sense dopamine involved motivated behaviors?
mean, say instance, won't ask run session [chuckles]
free. [Karl laughs] - off camera. - [Andrew] Off camera. Right.
say, "I just can't imagine tomorrow. just can't it." not action-based,
purely based internal narrative, imagine things like, know,
terrible time sleeping, not hungry, not eating, statements physical
actions, guessing also validity. - Absolutely. - now ways
measure accuracy statements. Like instance, gave permission,
know slept last night, whether not just saying poor
night's sleep. - Yes. right. - moving forward 2021 next
10 100 years psychiatry, think body reporting actions
human going become useful mesh words way going
make job easier? - think true. two things mentioned,
eating sleeping, additional criteria use diagnose depression.
vegetative signs, call depression, poor sleep, poor eating.
baseline somebody, real challenge there. different
person? people depressed, sleep more. people
depressed, sleep less. people depressed, physically


agitated, move around more. people depressed, move less
even awake. need... challenge can't just
look now. get baseline, see changed.
can challenge raises ethical issues, collect
baseline information someone healthy? don't think something
solved. course, phones accelerometers phones, principle,
collect lot baseline information people,

00:20:21 Predicting Depression & Suicide

treated carefully privacy reasons. - terms
measuring one's behavior, heard work going on. Sam Golden
University Washington works aggression animal models telling
efforts making, perhaps involved work well,
don't know, devices allow people detect, instance,
veering towards depressive episode themselves, may choose not
choose report clinician, maybe don't even clinician. Maybe
person referred beginning, person doesn't feel
comfortable coming talk you, maybe something measuring changes
inflection voice, speed get chair. think
kind metrics will eventually inform somebody, "Hey, know,
trouble"? getting back statement heard make rung
mind now, think decade, is, "Oftentimes, don't even know
feel." - Yeah. know, like, gives patient agency
detect going on, even separate modern technology,
part art psychiatry help patients realize sometimes people
observing can give earliest warning signs depression. see
often family. notice patient changing patient does.
things patient may notice, not correctly ascribe onset
depression. classic example call 'early morning awakening'.
something can happen early people start slide depression.
start wake earlier earlier, just inexplicably, awake at- - like
2:00 AM, 3:00 awakening? - start... Yeah, start 5:00 AM, go
four, three- - unable fall back asleep? - Unable fall back asleep.


Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.

human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going

MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

Psychiatry though, focuses disorders can't see something physically
wrong, don't measurable, no blood test makes
diagnosis, no brain scan tells us schizophrenia, depression
individual patient. psychiatry much mysterious, tools
words. Neurologists fantastic physicians. see stroke brain
scans, see seizure pre-seizure activity EEG, can
measure treat based measureables. psychiatry, harder job,
think. use words, rating scales symptoms, can measure depression
autism rating scales, words still. ultimately,
psychiatry built around. odd situation got complex,
beautiful, mysterious, incredibly engineered object universe, yet
words find way in. - So, find patient verbal hyper-
verbal, easier time diagnosing them, opposed somebody
quiet reserved? it's, imagine opposite might true well. -
Well, words, put finger key point. don't
speak much, principle, harder. lack speech can symptom. can
see depression, can see negative symptoms schizophrenia,
can see autism. Sometimes itself, symptom, reduced speech,
ultimately need something. need words help guide fact,
challenges can tell patients depression
depressed, can't speak. makes bit challenge distinguish depression


reasons might not speaking. sort art
science psychiatry. - find patients have, well,
call comorbidities conditions land psychiatry
neurology, meaning damage particular area brain therefore
depressed? tease psychiatrist? - Yeah,
happens time. Parkinson's disease great example. can debilitating
many ways. People trouble moving, trouble walking, trouble
swallowing, can truly severe depression. might
say, "Oh, well, got life-threatening illness", plenty neurological
disorders depression not strongly comorbid symptom, like ALS, Lou Gehrig's
disease, example, depression not strongly comorbid disease,
Parkinson's, extremely common. know, Parkinson's disease,
loss dopamine neurons midbrain. specific population
cells dying, probably leads movement disorder
depression. many examples two fields come together
really need work team. patients clinic, treat
depression associated Parkinson's,

00:12:19 Blood Tests Mental Disease

neurologist treats movement associated Parkinson's work

good, one challenges psychiatry art well
science elicit symptoms precise way. take time,
great just quick measurements. abused misused?



00:13:38 Largest Challenges Facing Treatment Mental Health

Certainly. think true, medicine. - want know, sure
several, see biggest challenge facing psychiatry
treatment mental illness today? - think making progress biggest
challenge is, think still strong stigma psychiatric disease
patients often don't come us, feel able handle
own. can slow treatment. can lead worsening symptoms. know,
example, patients untreated anxiety issues. go year
serious untreated anxiety issue, can convert depression. can add
another problem top anxiety. be... people not come
treatment? feel like something able master own,
can true, usually, help good thing. - raises question
related something heard say many years ago lecture, that,
scientific lecture said, "We don't know people feel.
time, don't even really know feel." - [chuckles] Yeah. - [Andrew] Maybe
elaborate little bit dearth ways talk
feelings. mean, many words. don't know many, guessing
dozen words describe state call sadness, far
understand, don't way comparing real objective sense.
psychiatrist, job use words diagnose, words patient diagnose,
maneuver around that? landscape call feelings
emotions? - really interesting. tension words
built clinic mean something physicians,
colloquial use words may not same, first level
sort someone says, "I'm depressed", exactly mean that?
may different talking terms depression. part
psychiatry get beyond word, get actually feeling, get rid
jargon get real world examples feeling. So, much
look forward future? much hope have? much planning
future? now getting actual things can talk
unambiguous. someone says, "Yeah, can't even think tomorrow. don't
see going get tomorrow". nice, precise thing know,


sad, tragic, also, means something. know means.
hopelessness symptom depression. try
psychiatric interview. try get past jargon, get actually happening
patient's life mind. say, ultimately, [chuckles] shows
across... address issue every day life, whether lab
looking animals, whether fish mice rats studying behavior,
conversation just friend colleague, talking patient,
never really know going inside mind person. get
feedback, get words, get behaviors, get actions, never really know.
said beginning question, often don't even words
insight even understand going mind. think lot psychiatrists
pretty introspective. part reason end specialty, so,
maybe spend little time average person thinking going
within, doesn't mean answers. - area trying figure
going hood words, sounds like certain words
relate idea anticipation hope. fair say somehow relates
dopamine system sense dopamine involved motivated behaviors?
mean, say instance, won't ask run session [chuckles]
free. [Karl laughs] - off camera. - [Andrew] Off camera. Right.
say, "I just can't imagine tomorrow. just can't it." not action-based,
purely based internal narrative, imagine things like, know,
terrible time sleeping, not hungry, not eating, statements physical
actions, guessing also validity. - Absolutely. - now ways
measure accuracy statements. Like instance, gave permission,
know slept last night, whether not just saying poor
night's sleep. - Yes. right. - moving forward 2021 next
10 100 years psychiatry, think body reporting actions
human going become useful mesh words way going
make job easier? - think true. two things mentioned,
eating sleeping, additional criteria use diagnose depression.
vegetative signs, call depression, poor sleep, poor eating.
baseline somebody, real challenge there. different
person? people depressed, sleep more. people
depressed, sleep less. people depressed, physically


agitated, move around more. people depressed, move less
even awake. need... challenge can't just
look now. get baseline, see changed.
can challenge raises ethical issues, collect
baseline information someone healthy? don't think something
solved. course, phones accelerometers phones, principle,
collect lot baseline information people,

00:20:21 Predicting Depression & Suicide

treated carefully privacy reasons. - terms
measuring one's behavior, heard work going on. Sam Golden
University Washington works aggression animal models telling
efforts making, perhaps involved work well,
don't know, devices allow people detect, instance,
veering towards depressive episode themselves, may choose not
choose report clinician, maybe don't even clinician. Maybe
person referred beginning, person doesn't feel
comfortable coming talk you, maybe something measuring changes
inflection voice, speed get chair. think
kind metrics will eventually inform somebody, "Hey, know,
trouble"? getting back statement heard make rung
mind now, think decade, is, "Oftentimes, don't even know
feel." - Yeah. know, like, gives patient agency
detect going on, even separate modern technology,
part art psychiatry help patients realize sometimes people
observing can give earliest warning signs depression. see
often family. notice patient changing patient does.
things patient may notice, not correctly ascribe onset
depression. classic example call 'early morning awakening'.
something can happen early people start slide depression.
start wake earlier earlier, just inexplicably, awake at- - like
2:00 AM, 3:00 awakening? - start... Yeah, start 5:00 AM, go
four, three- - unable fall back asleep? - Unable fall back asleep.


Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing

pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely

cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest

example, patients untreated anxiety issues. go year
serious untreated anxiety issue, can convert depression. can add

look forward future? much hope have? much planning
future? now getting actual things can talk
unambiguous. someone says, "Yeah, can't even think tomorrow. don't
see going get tomorrow". nice, precise thing know,


sad, tragic, also, means something. know means.
hopelessness symptom depression. try
psychiatric interview. try get past jargon, get actually happening
patient's life mind. say, ultimately, [chuckles] shows
across... address issue every day life, whether lab
looking animals, whether fish mice rats studying behavior,
conversation just friend colleague, talking patient,
never really know going inside mind person. get
feedback, get words, get behaviors, get actions, never really know.
said beginning question, often don't even words
insight even understand going mind. think lot psychiatrists
pretty introspective. part reason end specialty, so,
maybe spend little time average person thinking going
within, doesn't mean answers. - area trying figure
going hood words, sounds like certain words
relate idea anticipation hope. fair say somehow relates
dopamine system sense dopamine involved motivated behaviors?
mean, say instance, won't ask run session [chuckles]
free. [Karl laughs] - off camera. - [Andrew] Off camera. Right.
say, "I just can't imagine tomorrow. just can't it." not action-based,
purely based internal narrative, imagine things like, know,
terrible time sleeping, not hungry, not eating, statements physical
actions, guessing also validity. - Absolutely. - now ways
measure accuracy statements. Like instance, gave permission,
know slept last night, whether not just saying poor
night's sleep. - Yes. right. - moving forward 2021 next
10 100 years psychiatry, think body reporting actions
human going become useful mesh words way going
make job easier? - think true. two things mentioned,
eating sleeping, additional criteria use diagnose depression.
vegetative signs, call depression, poor sleep, poor eating.
baseline somebody, real challenge there. different
person? people depressed, sleep more. people
depressed, sleep less. people depressed, physically


agitated, move around more. people depressed, move less
even awake. need... challenge can't just
look now. get baseline, see changed.
can challenge raises ethical issues, collect
baseline information someone healthy? don't think something
solved. course, phones accelerometers phones, principle,
collect lot baseline information people,

00:20:21 Predicting Depression & Suicide

treated carefully privacy reasons. - terms
measuring one's behavior, heard work going on. Sam Golden
University Washington works aggression animal models telling
efforts making, perhaps involved work well,
don't know, devices allow people detect, instance,
veering towards depressive episode themselves, may choose not
choose report clinician, maybe don't even clinician. Maybe
person referred beginning, person doesn't feel
comfortable coming talk you, maybe something measuring changes
inflection voice, speed get chair. think
kind metrics will eventually inform somebody, "Hey, know,
trouble"? getting back statement heard make rung
mind now, think decade, is, "Oftentimes, don't even know
feel." - Yeah. know, like, gives patient agency
detect going on, even separate modern technology,
part art psychiatry help patients realize sometimes people
observing can give earliest warning signs depression. see
often family. notice patient changing patient does.
things patient may notice, not correctly ascribe onset
depression. classic example call 'early morning awakening'.
something can happen early people start slide depression.
start wake earlier earlier, just inexplicably, awake at- - like
2:00 AM, 3:00 awakening? - start... Yeah, start 5:00 AM, go
four, three- - unable fall back asleep? - Unable fall back asleep.


Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,

figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done

Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.

great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

00:13:38 Largest Challenges Facing Treatment Mental Health

Certainly. think true, medicine. - want know, sure
several, see biggest challenge facing psychiatry
treatment mental illness today? - think making progress biggest
challenge is, think still strong stigma psychiatric disease
patients often don't come us, feel able handle
own. can slow treatment. can lead worsening symptoms. know,
example, patients untreated anxiety issues. go year
serious untreated anxiety issue, can convert depression. can add
another problem top anxiety. be... people not come
treatment? feel like something able master own,
can true, usually, help good thing. - raises question
related something heard say many years ago lecture, that,
scientific lecture said, "We don't know people feel.
time, don't even really know feel." - [chuckles] Yeah. - [Andrew] Maybe
elaborate little bit dearth ways talk
feelings. mean, many words. don't know many, guessing
dozen words describe state call sadness, far
understand, don't way comparing real objective sense.
psychiatrist, job use words diagnose, words patient diagnose,
maneuver around that? landscape call feelings
emotions? - really interesting. tension words
built clinic mean something physicians,
colloquial use words may not same, first level
sort someone says, "I'm depressed", exactly mean that?
may different talking terms depression. part
psychiatry get beyond word, get actually feeling, get rid
jargon get real world examples feeling. So, much
look forward future? much hope have? much planning
future? now getting actual things can talk
unambiguous. someone says, "Yeah, can't even think tomorrow. don't
see going get tomorrow". nice, precise thing know,


sad, tragic, also, means something. know means.
hopelessness symptom depression. try
psychiatric interview. try get past jargon, get actually happening
patient's life mind. say, ultimately, [chuckles] shows
across... address issue every day life, whether lab
looking animals, whether fish mice rats studying behavior,
conversation just friend colleague, talking patient,
never really know going inside mind person. get
feedback, get words, get behaviors, get actions, never really know.
said beginning question, often don't even words
insight even understand going mind. think lot psychiatrists
pretty introspective. part reason end specialty, so,
maybe spend little time average person thinking going
within, doesn't mean answers. - area trying figure
going hood words, sounds like certain words
relate idea anticipation hope. fair say somehow relates
dopamine system sense dopamine involved motivated behaviors?
mean, say instance, won't ask run session [chuckles]
free. [Karl laughs] - off camera. - [Andrew] Off camera. Right.
say, "I just can't imagine tomorrow. just can't it." not action-based,
purely based internal narrative, imagine things like, know,
terrible time sleeping, not hungry, not eating, statements physical
actions, guessing also validity. - Absolutely. - now ways
measure accuracy statements. Like instance, gave permission,
know slept last night, whether not just saying poor
night's sleep. - Yes. right. - moving forward 2021 next
10 100 years psychiatry, think body reporting actions
human going become useful mesh words way going
make job easier? - think true. two things mentioned,
eating sleeping, additional criteria use diagnose depression.
vegetative signs, call depression, poor sleep, poor eating.
baseline somebody, real challenge there. different
person? people depressed, sleep more. people
depressed, sleep less. people depressed, physically


agitated, move around more. people depressed, move less
even awake. need... challenge can't just
look now. get baseline, see changed.
can challenge raises ethical issues, collect
baseline information someone healthy? don't think something

collect lot baseline information people,

00:20:21 Predicting Depression & Suicide

treated carefully privacy reasons. - terms
measuring one's behavior, heard work going on. Sam Golden
University Washington works aggression animal models telling
efforts making, perhaps involved work well,
don't know, devices allow people detect, instance,
veering towards depressive episode themselves, may choose not
choose report clinician, maybe don't even clinician. Maybe
person referred beginning, person doesn't feel
comfortable coming talk you, maybe something measuring changes
inflection voice, speed get chair. think
kind metrics will eventually inform somebody, "Hey, know,
trouble"? getting back statement heard make rung
mind now, think decade, is, "Oftentimes, don't even know
feel." - Yeah. know, like, gives patient agency
detect going on, even separate modern technology,
part art psychiatry help patients realize sometimes people
observing can give earliest warning signs depression. see
often family. notice patient changing patient does.
things patient may notice, not correctly ascribe onset
depression. classic example call 'early morning awakening'.
something can happen early people start slide depression.
start wake earlier earlier, just inexplicably, awake at- - like
2:00 AM, 3:00 awakening? - start... Yeah, start 5:00 AM, go
four, three- - unable fall back asleep? - Unable fall back asleep.


Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap

think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.

mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange

cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human

thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active

human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report

always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many

mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells

precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly

different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful

addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one

incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

00:20:21 Predicting Depression & Suicide

treated carefully privacy reasons. - terms
measuring one's behavior, heard work going on. Sam Golden
University Washington works aggression animal models telling
efforts making, perhaps involved work well,
don't know, devices allow people detect, instance,
veering towards depressive episode themselves, may choose not
choose report clinician, maybe don't even clinician. Maybe
person referred beginning, person doesn't feel
comfortable coming talk you, maybe something measuring changes
inflection voice, speed get chair. think
kind metrics will eventually inform somebody, "Hey, know,
trouble"? getting back statement heard make rung
mind now, think decade, is, "Oftentimes, don't even know
feel." - Yeah. know, like, gives patient agency
detect going on, even separate modern technology,
part art psychiatry help patients realize sometimes people
observing can give earliest warning signs depression. see
often family. notice patient changing patient does.
things patient may notice, not correctly ascribe onset
depression. classic example call 'early morning awakening'.
something can happen early people start slide depression.
start wake earlier earlier, just inexplicably, awake at- - like
2:00 AM, 3:00 awakening? - start... Yeah, start 5:00 AM, go
four, three- - unable fall back asleep? - Unable fall back asleep.


Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider
perspective, want ask little bit you. first all, realize
partial list, clinician, see patients, run big laboratory,
many people laboratory now? huge laboratory. experience,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke
grown area Northern California much counter-
culture now, many things hearing now, least


read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't
risks problems causing lasting change addiction. Now, said,
even medications exist now, know, impulse use
small doses use adjunctive treatments therapy various
kinds. also supportive done carefully rigorously, course

know, feeling colors hearing light things sort. hear reports,
anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis

think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount

represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns

taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens

understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

00:20:21 Predicting Depression & Suicide

treated carefully privacy reasons. - terms
measuring one's behavior, heard work going on. Sam Golden
University Washington works aggression animal models telling
efforts making, perhaps involved work well,
don't know, devices allow people detect, instance,
veering towards depressive episode themselves, may choose not
choose report clinician, maybe don't even clinician. Maybe
person referred beginning, person doesn't feel
comfortable coming talk you, maybe something measuring changes
inflection voice, speed get chair. think
kind metrics will eventually inform somebody, "Hey, know,
trouble"? getting back statement heard make rung
mind now, think decade, is, "Oftentimes, don't even know
feel." - Yeah. know, like, gives patient agency
detect going on, even separate modern technology,
part art psychiatry help patients realize sometimes people
observing can give earliest warning signs depression. see
often family. notice patient changing patient does.
things patient may notice, not correctly ascribe onset
depression. classic example call 'early morning awakening'.
something can happen early people start slide depression.
start wake earlier earlier, just inexplicably, awake at- - like
2:00 AM, 3:00 awakening? - start... Yeah, start 5:00 AM, go
four, three- - unable fall back asleep? - Unable fall back asleep.


Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider
perspective, want ask little bit you. first all, realize
partial list, clinician, see patients, run big laboratory,
many people laboratory now? huge laboratory. experience,

actually conversation yourself? - Yes. hearing literally, mean, not
quite literally, don't actually hear information, hearing words,
discovered myself. people, think may operate differently,
extremely verbal think. reasoning done. sentences
[chuckles] construction almost equations words. - Complete sentences? -
Complete sentences complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, writing

work days laboratory leader, job returned mostly words now,
again. kind coming full circle. different mode. think just
embrace different stages life, come different modes, can
definitely train mode. loved, mentioned, rhythm sewing
suturing surgery, worked really hard became good it. now,
never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke
grown area Northern California much counter-
culture now, many things hearing now, least


read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't
risks problems causing lasting change addiction. Now, said,
even medications exist now, know, impulse use
small doses use adjunctive treatments therapy various
kinds. also supportive done carefully rigorously, course
risk, risk many kinds treatments. not sure risks
medications vastly outweigh risks normally tolerate
branches medicine. - work? mean, say indeed main

anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis

something talk "Projections" book quite bit, many
filtered get conscious mind, good. Think distracted

us become aware incomplete hypotheses wrong hypotheses,
concepts might noise just wrong, never allowed get

think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount
value action, discount value world giving rise
future matters. Everything seems run like river just running desert

increasing escape tendrils process forward progression
world. concept, think it. ways can make
rigorous. can indeed identify brain recording, can see cells
represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.



01:59:42 Connecting Dr. Deisseroth Twitter

don't want give away much it, people definitely check
book. active social media? people want follow connect

Exactly. may not know that. just be, [chuckles]
perspective, just something happening. put enough
information together, useful warning sign patient help
seek treatment. think something really valuable. -
Interesting. So, framework needing words self-report machines detect
feel maybe inform psychiatrist patient feels, touch
technologies

00:22:47 Drugs Work Brain Illness

involved building, way march that,
good treatments psychiatric disease? Meaning, currently pills, potions,
forms communication reliably work every time, work patients?
give couple examples great successes psychiatry exist? - Yes.
Yeah, fortunate. [chuckles] coming back my, know, joking
wife terms neurology psychiatry, actually
psychiatry, despite depths mystery struggled with, many treatments
actually... may better specialties terms actually
causing therapeutic benefit patients. help patients, patients suffer
from... way, medications talk therapy shown extremely
effective many cases, example, people panic disorder, cognitive behavioral
therapy, just working words, helping people identify early signs
starting move toward panic attack, cognitions happening?
can train people derail that, can potently treat panic disorder way. -
long something like take average? - motivated, insightful patient,
can cookbooky series sessions, six 12 sessions, even less
someone insightful motivated can powerful effect
quickly. just words, many psychiatric medications
effective conditions treating. Anti-psychotic medications,
side effects, boy, work! really can clear particularly positive
symptoms schizophrenia example, auditory hallucinations, paranoia,
people's lives can turned around these- - clarify positive symptoms.
mean not positive qualitative sense, mean positive meaning
appearance something abnormal. - Exactly. Yeah. Thank clarification.


say positive symptoms, mean addition something wasn't
before, like hallucination paranoia, stands contrast
negative symptoms something taken away, patients
withdrawn. call thought blocking. can't even progress forward
sequence thoughts. can part schizophrenia, hallucinations
paranoia effectively treated right now, effectively treated.
then, frustrating, yet heartening aspect psychiatry.
treatments like electroconvulsive therapy, extremely effective depression.
patients nothing else works them, can't tolerate
medications, can administer safe, controlled condition,
patient's body not moving. put safe situation body
doesn't move cease, just internal process triggered brain.
extraordinarily effective treatment treatment-resistant depression. time,
find [chuckles] heartening see patients respond severe
depression, also frustrated it. can't something precise this,
severe cases? people sought decades understand,
seizure leading relief depression? don't know answer yet.
love that. People working hard that, treatment
work too. cases though psychiatry, frustrating thing
don't level understanding cardiologist thinking heart.
know, heart is, now know pump. pumping blood. can
look everything working not working, terms frame,
clearly pump. don't really level of, circuit really
psychiatry? missing.

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back

Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not

great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link

thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active

mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells

precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just

00:27:01 Cure Broken Mind Look Like?

need find, can design truly effective specific treatments. -
So, pieces going required cure autism, cure Parkinson's,
cure schizophrenia? imagine several elements 'beens here',
understanding natural biology, understanding activity patterns are,
modify those, maybe just tell us think, Bento Box
perfect cure? - think first thing need understanding. Almost every psychiatric
treatment serendipitously identified, just noting chance something


done person also side effect- - Like lithium something- - Like
lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,
example. - not know that. - Yeah, classic example illnesses
across psychiatry, course seizures well. noticed
patients epilepsy, seizure also depression,
became much, least awhile, improved seizure. -
amazing. don't want take off course question answering question
asked, heard autistic children get fever, symptoms
improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.
deficit social interaction communication. that? [chuckles]
situated? key principle governing social interaction?
need basic science bring us step forward, can say okay,
process going on. needed incredibly complex task
social interaction, got incredibly rich data streams sound meaning,
eye contact, body movement, just one person. group
people? overwhelming people autism. unifying thing there?
lot information, maybe unmatched realm biology, amount


information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

lithium, good example. - true urine guinea pigs [Karl laughs]
given lithium given manic patients made not manic? true? -
don't firsthand knowledge that, defer that, true essentially
every treatment, antidepressants originally arose anti-tuberculosis drugs,

improve, true? - done fair bit work autism. clinical practice,
work adult autism heard statements like descriptions like
patients families. hard study quantitatively often
children, not quantitative like collection symptom
information home. heard enough think may well
something that. anytime fever, going on? Well, know
cells brain, know electrophysiologist, just change
temperature degrees, everything changes neurons work
even just single neuron. even likely complex different circuit
neurons affecting other. Just elevate temperature little bit,
everything's different. so, plausible sure, things like happen
happen. yet, think autism, take example, yes,
see changes, elements brain analogous pumping
heart? think symptoms depression, think motivation
dopamine neurons. think autism, little challenging.

'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely

cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG

human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just

activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything

amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins

see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,

them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good

clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing

information coming social interaction, particularly words language.
then, turns attention neuroscientists, think, okay, think
parts brain involved dealing merging complex data streams
high bit rate need fused together unitary concept.
starts guide us, know animals social way,
can study animals. think it. hope future,
thinking symptoms engineer might, trying identify circuits
likely working make typical behavior happen, will help us understand
becomes atypical. - seems like first me, first this,
call Bento Box lack better analogy, need know circuits.
need know cells various brain regions end portions body
connect one another, patterns activity normal
'healthy interaction'. - [Karl] Yeah. - understand that, seems next
step, course carried parallel, right? Though work can
done alongside work various elements within circuits tweaked just right,
like tuning piano subtle way, maybe even like replacement
whole set keys piano lacking keys, speak.

00:32:23 Channelopsins: Tools Understanding & Treating Mind

- Right. - involved trying generate tools. Tell us
channelopsins, created them, now laboratory
perhaps also clinic. - Well, first all, give nature credit creating
channelrhodopsins. beautiful little proteins made algae, single-
celled green algae. great story basic science understanding
animal behavior, sensation, cognition action brains way back
botanist 1850s 1860s Russia, story begins.
botanist named Andrei Famintsyn worked St. Petersburg, noticed
river near laboratory, algae look dish,
saucer. put light shining side. green tinge
saucer water move particular distance light
shining side, amazing thing. made light brighter,
green tinge back off little bit optimal location, just right light
level. plant behavior. light-driven plant behavior, delves


little bit. identified microscopy, see little
single-cell algae flagella swimming right light level. behaving
plants, secret helped us unlock many principles animal
behavior. turns out, algae achieve amazing results single gene
encodes single protein. protein? just little bio-molecule job
cell. proteins sit surface cells surface membrane,
photon, light particle hits them, open little pore, little hole
membrane charged particles, ions like sodium rush across pore. Now,
that? guide flagella, signal coming in, ions
coming pore response light, guide flagella motor, guides
particular spot saucer. Now, plant behavior, turns out,
know, movement ions across membrane, happens also neural
code brains off. Sodium ions rushing cells, turns on.
makes fire away, fire action potentials communicate next cell
chain, amazing opportunity can borrow proteins. fact,
can take gene directs creation protein, can use genetic
tricks, modern genetic tricks put gene neurons brains mammals,
use light turn cells, specific cells put gene into, turn
on. opsins, call them, can use turn cells off. fast,
real time. can play patterns activity real time cells kinds cells, just
conductor elicits music orchestra, strings woodwinds.
can see matters. matters sensation, matters cognition,
matters action, call optogenetics. - Beautiful, must say quite
honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got

wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report

mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells

precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help

addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

honor privilege watch optogenetics move idea discovery
laboratory. think postdocs time, - were, huh? - living
proof people move different rates, [laughs] joke expense
way, [Karl laughing] really- - end spot. [laughs] -
right, [laughs] yeah, less. Physically, not professionally, nonetheless,
marvelous story thus far. like to... Maybe give us... like
just touch couple examples technology resides laboratories now,
maybe range animals used in, phenomenon
channelrhodopsins related genes proteins starting elicit,
seen, like talk applicability clinic, think
bigger mission, will. - Yeah. whole thing, know, about, now


going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little

thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior

gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise

goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

going 17 years putting channelrhodopsins neurons. started just
like Andre Famintsyn's work dish, 2004. 2007, putting
behaving mice, able flick switch, cause move one
direction another, 2009- - basically, controlling mouse's behavior? -
Yeah, exactly. real time. make mouse just sitting
nothing, turn left consistently, fact, go around circle soon
turn off light, stop. eye-opening moment. took really
years make optogenetics work. lot putting the... lot
problems solved. channelrhodopsins actually don't move many
ions. small current, small conductance, say. figure
ways pack lot cells without damaging cells, still make
targetable, don't want just cells, 'cause becomes just
like electrode. just stimulating cells nearby. keep
specificity, make targetable just one kind cell another, still
packing large numbers cells. get light safe
specific ways, took probably four five years really create
optogenetics 2004 2009. end time though,
basic light delivery, gene delivery, principles worked out, people started apply

00:39:10 Curing Blindness Channelopsins

technology fish, rats, mice, non-human primates like monkeys, just
couple months ago, colleague, Botond Rosca Switzerland, succeeded putting
channelrhodopsins eyes human beings making blind person see.
pretty cool. patient retinal degeneration, provided
channelrhodopsin eye patient able confer light
sensitivity onto patient wasn't before. - amazing paper discovery.
realize one patient, important milestone. - Well, say,
important milestone history deep. Almost 10 years earlier,
Botond Rosca published paper science human retina, X plants
taken cadavers someone died, living retina taken out, opsins put
retinal tissue showing worked, recording cells showing
human retinal neurons, get light responses. then,
moment, almost 10 years clinical development goes, gene therapy


got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider
perspective, want ask little bit you. first all, realize
partial list, clinician, see patients, run big laboratory,
many people laboratory now? huge laboratory. experience,
can say enormous laboratory. family five children,
happily married wonderful colleague well, incredible work.
organize kind conceptual level, day week? say,
stress mitigation practices any, incorporate? received emails
three morning. sometimes send emails three morning,
wake up, maybe depressed, go back sleep. So, maybe just describe arc
blocks day, not hour hour, necessarily details


blocks, conceptualize day? conceptualize week?
feel lined larger goals making sure
five young people flourish? hear are, go this,
people just overwhelming set items? - Well, course
sometimes just take day day, don't claim- - bring horizon
unit day? - do, do. unit day, right. try
day, mentioned earlier, least hour time can think, can
kids napping, actually, driving can too,
sitting still, [clears throat] one thing try preserve. writing
book, adapted time writing time, wasn't enough, add
new block time sort midnight 2:00 AM, writing time. [chuckles]
carving these, even small protected times important. course, obligations
will expand fill time available disciplined. least found
disciplined truly protecting times one can think. - means no
phone? - means no phone, no checking phone. writing book,

documents pure, don't temptation distraction. -
big believer vision eyes play prominent role directing
cognition, something talk book, really beautifully, lot
depth rigor, using visual tools harness one's complete mental attention.
practice sitting just thinking, sitting still thinking, said eyes
open. hearing verbal voice, although head? - Yes. -
actually conversation yourself? - Yes. hearing literally, mean, not
quite literally, don't actually hear information, hearing words,
discovered myself. people, think may operate differently,
extremely verbal think. reasoning done. sentences
[chuckles] construction almost equations words. - Complete sentences? -
Complete sentences complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, writing
book, everything writing, every sentence always played mind,
listening rhythm timing, obsess exact placement words get
right rhythm spoken sentence mind. - don't mean interrupt flow,
that, experienced process bit, although differently,

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke
grown area Northern California much counter-
culture now, many things hearing now, least


read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't
risks problems causing lasting change addiction. Now, said,
even medications exist now, know, impulse use
small doses use adjunctive treatments therapy various
kinds. also supportive done carefully rigorously, course

anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis

think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount

future matters. Everything seems run like river just running desert


drying up, agents may increase flow circuitry,

world. concept, think it. ways can make
rigorous. can indeed identify brain recording, can see cells
represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

got regulations concerns that. took almost 10 years
get point now living human new functionality wasn't
before. Now, incredibly inspiring, beautiful thing. say
though, broader significance optogenetics really still understanding,
understand circuitry works cells actually matter,
kind treatment becomes grounded logical specific
principled. whether medication, talk therapy brain stimulation treatment
electrical magnetic means, actually know matters, [chuckles]
incredibly powerful. think, not intended disparage beautiful retinal work
conferring vision someone couldn't see, course wonderful,
direct might call direct optogenetics patients. Indirect everything
comes understanding. Okay, know cells matter now, symptom.
Well, can target cells help work better patients
means? think broader significance optogenetics, clinically. - know
Botond well, Botond share incredible big vision, think
clinician can really understand,

00:41:58 Karl Became Scientist

close contact within suffering patients ultimate motivator
developing technologies, makes ask, decide become
scientist find cures mental disease? - [chuckles] No, didn't. really important
question actually look back see steps brought particular place.
not brought initially science okay think, embrace
[chuckles] twists turns life brings you, always interested
brain. so, something started early age. talked
introspective. noticed early deep love poetry stories,
voracious reader, amazed words make feel
particular ways. Even separate their, course, dictionary meanings, rhythm,
work together, even separate meaning. stunned poets
use words new ways even divorced meaning all,
yet still trigger specific emotions. always fascinating me. So,
wanted understand that, interested became interested brain
thought, well, going study human brain, human


beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric

wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going

explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

beings can describe going inside enough. college, began steer
toward medicine, idea becoming neurosurgeon. came
medical school, MD PhD program, planning neurosurgery way
through. first rotation end medical school, know,
rotations, go different specialties, required rotations,
everybody summary elective can pick want do.
elected neurosurgery first, [chuckles] even regular surgery.
sure wanted it, loved it. fantastic time. amazing patient
thalamic damage, neglect syndrome patient
not able aware something right front him- - Even though
vision perfectly fine? - Even though vision perfectly fine, exactly.
loved operating room, loved rhythm suturing precision it,
loved able help patients immediately, required rotation
psychiatry, not looking forward all. completely reset whole
life, experience psychiatry. moment saw first all,
greatest need, depth suffering depth mystery together. also
was, almost feel little guilty this. interesting too. Yes, can help. Yes,
need, scientist, amazing, someone's reality can different
own, everything physically, far can tell
measures have, yet got different reality. amazing thing,
can understand help people, just anybody
ask for. ended taking path, just required rotation
psychiatry. - started poetry? - started poetry. - respect
poetry, favorites spend time regular basis? - mean,
ones got path early on, remember childhood high school,
Borges immense influence me. studied Spanish way
reading work. great writer. wrote English Spanish
able appreciate poetry English Spanish pretty amazing
thing. Not many poets can that. - bilingual? - not, wouldn't say. Now
became, one point effectively fluent Spanish, pretty good medical
Spanish still use Spanish time clinic here. wouldn't claim full
fluency, something can definitely use time. helpful
clinic. - Yeah, Borges wonderful. son Argentine, grew hearing
learned Borges' favorite city Geneva. spent time Geneva


reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider
perspective, want ask little bit you. first all, realize
partial list, clinician, see patients, run big laboratory,
many people laboratory now? huge laboratory. experience,
can say enormous laboratory. family five children,
happily married wonderful colleague well, incredible work.
organize kind conceptual level, day week? say,
stress mitigation practices any, incorporate? received emails

blocks, conceptualize day? conceptualize week?
feel lined larger goals making sure
five young people flourish? hear are, go this,

practice sitting just thinking, sitting still thinking, said eyes
open. hearing verbal voice, although head? - Yes. -
actually conversation yourself? - Yes. hearing literally, mean, not
quite literally, don't actually hear information, hearing words,
discovered myself. people, think may operate differently,
extremely verbal think. reasoning done. sentences
[chuckles] construction almost equations words. - Complete sentences? -
Complete sentences complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, writing
book, everything writing, every sentence always played mind,
listening rhythm timing, obsess exact placement words get

work days laboratory leader, job returned mostly words now,
again. kind coming full circle. different mode. think just
embrace different stages life, come different modes, can
definitely train mode. loved, mentioned, rhythm sewing
suturing surgery, worked really hard became good it. now,
never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke
grown area Northern California much counter-
culture now, many things hearing now, least


read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't
risks problems causing lasting change addiction. Now, said,
even medications exist now, know, impulse use
small doses use adjunctive treatments therapy various
kinds. also supportive done carefully rigorously, course

willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis
going on. never reach conscious mind.
something talk "Projections" book quite bit, many
filtered get conscious mind, good. Think distracted
constantly evaluate hypotheses kinds
shapes objects processes there. lot handled
gets consciousness. psychedelics seem do, change threshold
us become aware incomplete hypotheses wrong hypotheses,
concepts might noise just wrong, never allowed get
conscious mind. Now, pretty interesting, goes wrong psychiatric disorders.
think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount
value action, discount value world giving rise
future matters. Everything seems run like river just running desert


drying up, agents may increase flow circuitry,
will, percolation activity circuitry may end depression
increasing escape tendrils process forward progression
world. concept, think it. ways can make
rigorous. can indeed identify brain recording, can see cells
represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

reason. also turns [Karl laughs] interesting city. - Yes. -
developed methods control neurons

00:47:10 Vagus Nerve Depression

algae proteins using light? - Yeah. - 2015, thought
nice article published New Yorker, describing work current state
work laboratory clinic, interaction patient.
recall, woman severely depressed, reported article
discussion patient, real time, increased activation so-
called vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve extends skull innervates
many viscera body. potential channelrhodopsins related
types algae engineering used manipulate vagus? believe
instance, wasn't channelopsin stimulation, electrical stimulation, right?
manipulate instance, small localized region brain? Let frame little
bit differently light talking couple minutes ago.
understanding somebody severe depression take number
available pharmaceutical agents there, SSRI, serotonergic agents,
increased dopamine, increased whatever, sometimes experience relief,
often serious side effects. Sometimes don't experience relief,
understand it, channelopsins related technology, principle, allow
turn off specific regions brain lead depressive symptoms,
maybe turn happiness circuit, positive anticipation circuit.
now terms bringing technology nervous system? start
body, move skull. - Yup. starting body good example
highlights opportunity far go. take
example vagus nerve stimulation. vagus nerve, 10th cranial nerve.
comes brain, goes innervates heart innervates gut.
innervate, mean sends little connections help guide happens
organs abdomen chest. also collects information back,
information coming back organs also go vagus nerve,
10th cranial nerve, back brain. somewhat super highway
brain, idea. maybe idea maybe put little cuff, little
electrical device around vagus nerve itself, maybe just like pacemaker


battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider
perspective, want ask little bit you. first all, realize
partial list, clinician, see patients, run big laboratory,
many people laboratory now? huge laboratory. experience,
can say enormous laboratory. family five children,
happily married wonderful colleague well, incredible work.
organize kind conceptual level, day week? say,
stress mitigation practices any, incorporate? received emails
three morning. sometimes send emails three morning,
wake up, maybe depressed, go back sleep. So, maybe just describe arc
blocks day, not hour hour, necessarily details


blocks, conceptualize day? conceptualize week?
feel lined larger goals making sure
five young people flourish? hear are, go this,
people just overwhelming set items? - Well, course
sometimes just take day day, don't claim- - bring horizon
unit day? - do, do. unit day, right. try
day, mentioned earlier, least hour time can think, can
kids napping, actually, driving can too,
sitting still, [clears throat] one thing try preserve. writing
book, adapted time writing time, wasn't enough, add
new block time sort midnight 2:00 AM, writing time. [chuckles]
carving these, even small protected times important. course, obligations
will expand fill time available disciplined. least found
disciplined truly protecting times one can think. - means no
phone? - means no phone, no checking phone. writing book,
focus mode MacBook kind rules border, just
documents pure, don't temptation distraction. -
big believer vision eyes play prominent role directing
cognition, something talk book, really beautifully, lot
depth rigor, using visual tools harness one's complete mental attention.
practice sitting just thinking, sitting still thinking, said eyes
open. hearing verbal voice, although head? - Yes. -
actually conversation yourself? - Yes. hearing literally, mean, not
quite literally, don't actually hear information, hearing words,
discovered myself. people, think may operate differently,
extremely verbal think. reasoning done. sentences
[chuckles] construction almost equations words. - Complete sentences? -
Complete sentences complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, writing
book, everything writing, every sentence always played mind,
listening rhythm timing, obsess exact placement words get
right rhythm spoken sentence mind. - don't mean interrupt flow,
that, experienced process bit, although differently,
experience kind welling anxiety hitting friction points?
so, tools ways quell anxiety real time? 'Cause


really talking mind. really talking
process converting activity neurons, something physically concrete
world. intermediate steps mysterious everybody. hear, "Just
write book", "Just it", whatever means. fact, statements like
kind empty meaningless, hear voice trying find
correct word keep hitting, doesn't sound quite right, experience
body? - Yeah, not right, definitely evasive, doesn't feel good,
also hope know can solve too, almost like almost
there. path know there, don't quite see it, there.
keep mind, propulsive force forward know
solution there. said, single words spend days on,
just not happy got right. things never
quite got perfect, left book entirely close, not
quite there. like, no, can't put in. - Everything just said entirely
consistent experience you, [both laughing] way go
everything. ask, kids writers? like books words
poetry? know one children going career medicine science. -
Yeah. different amazing, yet all, think
appreciation lot appreciation reading, musical. Two
five extremely musical, very, talented guitar singing vocal,
impressions, just astonishing. great drawing artistry
physical vigorous never happy except leaping
about. so, just amazing different are, honestly. think
shared appreciation language. - think one can train mind using
practices? really like description staying physically still learning
grapple challenges. something that, especially laboratory science,
aren't really trained do. Like many professions taught come just get

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke
grown area Northern California much counter-
culture now, many things hearing now, least


read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't
risks problems causing lasting change addiction. Now, said,
even medications exist now, know, impulse use
small doses use adjunctive treatments therapy various
kinds. also supportive done carefully rigorously, course
risk, risk many kinds treatments. not sure risks
medications vastly outweigh risks normally tolerate
branches medicine. - work? mean, say indeed main

way think two extremes experience anyways, high degree stress

essentially not rigid. element synesthesia, blending senses,
know, feeling colors hearing light things sort. hear reports,
anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis

something talk "Projections" book quite bit, many

think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount

world. concept, think it. ways can make
rigorous. can indeed identify brain recording, can see cells
represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

battery, little power source clavicle, everything skin,
little cuff drive signals, maybe get back brain. way
getting brain without putting something physical brain. -
vagus? mean, accessible- - reason. - [chuckles]
reason? - [chuckles] reason, yes. - Really? - Yeah. - not kidding? -
[Karl] not kidding. - stimulating vagus treat depression, simply
accessible. - started actually epilepsy treatment can help epilepsy,
yes, simple. - God, got love medicine. scientist, get
chuckle say, field medicine perspective.
perspective scientist outsider, field medicine field goes
tickles pathways there. don't know say. little shocking. -
Yeah. least laboratory, always say never experiment
can, experiment test specific hypothesis. - Yeah. Yeah. mean,
stories people tell vagus nerve lands particular spot brain
called solitary tract nucleus, just one snaps away serotonin
dopamine norepinephrine- - link chemical systems brain-
make irrational choice? - Yes. not irrational, can tell even
not true, thing tried. [Andrew laughs] - guys
done anyway. - accessible. Yeah. - [Andrew] see. Okay. -
why? Well, again, not disparage happening branch medicine.
immense suffering, many treatments don't work, try things.
many advances medicine happen. think kidney dialysis
kept many people alive, just started someone saying, "Hey, try this.
Maybe something building blood maybe can dialyze something
help them." Yeah, worked. just sort test pilot mentality. can
access blood, run across dialysis membrane, put back body, oh
God, actually works. sometimes need test pilot mentality, course,
rigorous, safe, controlled way- - Sure. - do. so,
anyway, ended up, still vagus nerve stimulation, okay,
it? work? has, FDA approved depression, vagus nerve
stimulation, population level, average across people, effect sizes
pretty small. patients amazing effect in, patients doesn't
work all, average across everybody, effect size pretty small. -
think working work? triggering activation neurons release


serotonin dopamine? - be, say don't evidence
just don't know. clear, dose-limited high
strongly can stimulate why, electrode, stimulating
everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,
every electrically responsive cell projection neck affected
electrode. can go just far intensity, stop.
So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B
know, causes symptom relief particular kind, business. can
cell light sensitive. not going affect cells,
larynx pharynx projections passing through. hope,
opportunity. problem, don't yet level specific
knowledge. don't know, okay, cells starting point going point B,
relieves particular symptom.

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits
DNA, package AAV, little virus, can injected
particular part body, sticking vagus nerve example, know
particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger
clump cells, maybe size clump cells.
don't know, credit card 200 microns thick side, micron
thousandths millimeter, talking little tiny stamp basically
half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just

activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.

see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful

variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

everything nearby. turn vagus nerve stimulator, patient's voice
becomes strangulated hoarse, can trouble swallowing, can
trouble speaking sure, even trouble breathing, everything neck,

So, initial question, precise stimulation method like optogenetics
help setting? principle, could, target light sensitivity
just right kind cell, say cell X goes point point B

00:54:12 Challenges Overcome Treating Mental Illness Channelopsins

- want fix key piano? - Yeah. - see two steps
required. One get channelopsin gene cell. case Botond Rosca
colleagues rescuing vision patient, injection virus
doesn't damage neurons. virus fairly innocuous, carries cargo,
one-time injection, cells express, used light stimulate. So,
say depressed, don't think am, although now sitting front psychiatrist,
[Karl laughs] probably can see signs maybe maybe not, say
put channelopsin specific branch vagus understand
responsible mood, going get there? And, going
deliver light? 'Cause not talking sunlight standing front light
bulb necessarily, mechanisms body? - Yeah. solve
exactly questions saying. get light in? get
gene in, potent robust safe way? now solved, not
challenge. safe, well-tolerated gene delivery mechanisms


called adeno-associated viruses, AAVs, things associated
common cold. don't cause symptoms.
engineered, broad community viral engineering going
decades making safer, well-tolerated, on. can put
channelrhodopsin gene viral vectors deliver gene can
little bits additional DNA govern expression one kind cell, not
another. called promoters enhancers, genetic tricks built
broad community great scientists decades. can put different bits

particular clumps neurons. one called nodose ganglion
clump cells related vagus nerve, example, target little
injection ganglion- - outpatient procedure? - Yep. Yep. -
come morning, get injection, maybe walk hours later? -
Yeah. right. gene, light delivery, also something
worked out. worked making very, light-sensitive opsins. One
challenge, Botond first state fact, [chuckles] solving
problem patient, build goggles created much brighter light
normal ambient light delivery, mentioned earlier, pack lot
channelrhodopsins in, don't much current. really make sure
got tense enough light activate enough cause stimulation- -
right wavelength, right? - right wavelength- -
going back example algae moving toward away light,
tuned just right. imagining mind non-engineer, know [chuckles]
also bioengineer, imagining little tiny blue light-emitting object, little bigger

half millimeter size around. edge, half millimeter size. can imagine
put skin, what, hit app phone, say,
"Dr. Deisseroth, not feeling great today. Can increase stimulation?"
say, "Go it." ramp up. go? - mean,
effectively already vagus nerve stimulation. doctor case,




00:58:34 Using Dialogue Patients Guide Treatment

patients clinic, vagus nerve stimulation. talk them, say,
"How you?" go symptoms, use psychiatric interview elicit
internal states, radio frequency controller can dial in- - Right
real time? - Right real time. - holding remote control
essentially brain, although remote controlled? - Yeah, couple
steps, yeah. can turn frequency, can turn intensity,
radio frequency control, reprogrammed redosed,
patient can leave altered dose. - happening now? -
happening right now, electrically. - routinely? - routinely clinic,
electrically, yeah. - getting verbal content, described earlier,
indication well something working real time? - Yes. - what,
maybe just describe little bit interaction particular patient
another patient, typical arc narrative go no stimulation
increased stimulation? - patients, actual therapeutic effects, benefits
actually take many days weeks, mostly focusing office
real time, making sure safe, low side effect regime. first talk
patient particular dose stimulation weeks longer,
talk symptoms, things past month? hope?
energy level? Sleep? mood? talk patient
decide, well, not yet like be. then, can turn
intensity stimulation real time office. patients, don't expect
immediate mood change. do, increase dose next level up,
asking patient side effects. Can still breathe? Okay. Can still swallow?
Okay. can hear voice well. can get sense- - looking
face? - looking face. - Yeah. - can get sense, still
safe side effect regime? then, stop particular point looks safe,

01:00:52 Eyes Reveal Mental Health

patient goes home, comes back month later, get report
things month. - asked looking face, 'cause book,


describe incredible complexity social interactions. one point,
describe incredible amount information eyes inform brain
context somebody's inner experience, whether depressed happy otherwise. -
Yeah. - want make sure get back maneuver manipulate
nervous system sake mental health. But, looking for?
vision scientist, think pupils dilating sign arousal, positive
arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-

happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal

motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-

know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know

purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely

cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior

gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise

can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure

gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good

think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just

activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,

think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.

see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns

taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug

drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one

incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

arousal, positive valence, like excitement, terror. - Yeah. - going
get dilation pupils. always reminding people two little
goodies two pieces brain, basically, [Karl chuckles] just outside cranial
vault. not unlike vagus sense, report
control knob, although like think used control knobs too. So,
without putting spot, again, diagnose me, [Karl laughs] something
never ask [Karl laughing] cameras rolling,
looking patient might not aware of? words, can see
depression somebody's eyes? know patient don't, can see
body posture walk in? Realizing course, trained psychiatrist
like yourself, develops intuitive sense aggregating lots different features
patient, eyes? going there? - Yeah. eyes
incredibly rich information. alluded though, not one
measurable conveys information need. engineer say, joint
statistics. many things once, whether synchrony synchrony,
actually turns matter. eye contact question, know eye contact
incredibly important. don't feel connected somebody, unless
eye contact, eye contact can go awry too. can intense, can
mistimed, someone autism, can barely all. one
striking symptoms autism, avoidance eye contact, almost
harmful quantity. immense amount information get
eyes, pairing going eyes, everything else going on,
body language, verbal content coming out. together art
psychiatry social interaction. sometimes don't eye contact.
amazing thing talk book well. many cases
psychiatry, sometimes phone make key decisions.
recall, vividly resident, often take phone calls
people not hospital, people can't see, can't see eyes,


can't see body anything them, just sound voice. can
ask questions, make, cases, life death decisions.
person truly suicidal? Something like that, comes time.
developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.

patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just

activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going

MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns

taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens

understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

developed course training, think psychiatrists this, develop
way data stream have, whether eyes whether just sound
voice coming phone, learn hone data stream
focus identify changes quite amazing. found can actually...
know patient, can detect precise changes mood, just sound
voice. can realization oh, patient's depression improved
half, just tone voice. eyes, enough practice,
can get enough information single data stream give information,
whole picture that, course, best. - So, many
theories excessive blinking lying, lack blinking sociopathy.
like remind people people varying degrees lubrication eyes, [Karl
laughs] also influence frequency blinking presumably nothing
whether not saying true not. incredible, nonetheless,
eyes portal overall arousal state.

01:06:04 Controlling Structures Deep Brain

fascinated effects light circadian biology just overall desire
awake asleep, et cetera. eyes outside cranial vault.
vagus outside cranial vault, obviously. goodies here?
Parkinson's, know least one major sites degeneration failure lead
symptoms. can name off number things. book, talk
beautiful work done optogenetics active versus passive coping,
areas brain like habenula active, make animals
presumably people, passive unwilling, uninterested fighting back
pressures life, whereas another region, raphe, stimulate that,
actively cope. get grit going, able lean life. So,
one get structures focused way? next two five, 10
years look like? - Well, promise that, timescale think
things may start play out. specificity optogenetics really useful
idea use specificity. actually, frustrating aspect


psychiatry many cases, effective treatments have, least
specificity, electroconvulsive therapy great example, causing
brainwide- - looks barbaric, mentioned effective. - mean, is.
days, much clinically safe- - doesn't look like one fluid last seen
lab [indistinct] - No doesn't. Now clinically safe stable procedure,
say yeah, got almost medieval lack specificity, even
procedure well-controlled clinically safe stable, not specific.
causing brainwide seizure. less specific that? -
don't know source relief. - [Karl] don't know- - Presumably dump
neuromodulators like dopamine serotonin, don't really know- -
certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause
relief.

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can

human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity

explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns

taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens

patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

certainly dump neuromodulators. don't know cause

01:08:23 Effective Drugs Often Side Effects

likewise medications, awesome interesting thing.
effective antidepressants, effective anti-psychotics ones
side effects many examples this. example,
effective anti-psychotic something called clozapine, unquestionably
side effects. terrible, terrible side effects. - D4 antagonist? -
basically every receptor. [laughs] - really? - Yeah. - Interesting. - Yeah,
prominent serotonin, prominent muscarinic, certainly acts dopamine receptors,
causes blood cell counts change- [laughs] - people feel?
schizophrenic getting auditory hallucinations, et cetera, took clozapine,
expect feel? - Well, notice side effects,
notice resolution symptoms and- - voices go away? - Yeah. -
good situation, voices go away? - right. - feel not good
body? - might dizziness, might drooling, might
number physical sensations due off target effects,
medication acting receptors- - certainly not suggesting this,
somebody without schizophrenia took clozapine?

01:09:50 Psychiatrists Take Drugs Prescribe?



- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-
emitting diode, deep brain, envision someday? - certainly


happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal
understanding. know, already moving rapidly toward point,
know okay, symptom, loss pleasure life call anhedonia, loss
motivation energy overcome challenges, active coping, largely
subserved, largely controlled circuit circuit cell inhabits
circuit. - will know work done channelopsins? -
Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-
based treatment psychiatric disease available, targets specific set cells
know important work done channelopsins? - think
ways already happening level individual patients- -
Stanford? - Yeah. Yup. broadly terms new drugs, new multi-centered
clinical trials will play next years. drugs
already safe approved purposes, might say okay, now know


medication, based know causal optogenetics, useful
purpose, psychiatric symptom. path helping patients

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link

touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many

mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording

- side effects presumably, yeah. not something
recommend. - Yeah. psychiatrists take drugs prescribe?
[Karl laughs] just finished third time, Oliver Sacks' autobiography
marvelous highly recommend people. certainly took lot drugs, not
part professional role, just curiosity, interest kind role
drugs field psychiatry? imagine group curious
introspective people making recommendations take,
actually benefit understanding experience drugs like
patients. - think true. will say probably many
psychiatrists sampled number exactly reason saying
understand better help treat patients better. spoken people
found helpful know, okay, sleep disruption caused
medication libido disruption caused medication. Wow, big
effect. really helps empathy patients understand. - not
suggesting physicians anybody experiment drugs, relieved hear
that, think talking accessing somebody's mind
basic physiology, mentioned, relate appetite, libido sleep, really,
one acting mechanic person's whole experience. walk
office life experience extends beyond script. - Yeah.
time though, can't let completely guide clinical decisions,
mentioned, medications side effects,
also effective clozapine great example. will work
patients nothing else works. believe me, don't take step clozapine
prescription lightly, side effects. come weekly
blood cell, every weeks blood cell check, make sure blood counts
not off example, patients no medication works
schizophrenia clozapine works amazingly well- - marvelous. -
it, even though side effects. comes back question,
better better specificity? Well, know exactly
point. become refined, better right
refining to.. - imagine day will single,
maybe even outpatient neurosurgery, go skull back
ear, deliver small viral injection one adenoviruses, little sticker light-

happen. actually prefer vision still medications,
minimally invasive. knew doing, make specific,
fewer side effects, optogenetics, will arm us true causal

Exactly. - Yeah. agree. - ways never confidence otherwise.
know circuit underlies symptom resolution.
get understand cells deeply, okay, cells causal,
matter, they? wiring? proteins make?
little things surface cell receptors
specific medications combinations receptors give us specificity
need? then, armed causal precise rigorous knowledge,
can imagine

01:14:15 Moving Experimental Tools Novel Treaments

medication development becoming totally different, no longer serendipitous, truly
grounded causality. - see. using channelopsins way probe circuitry
figure sites disrupted, patterns activity required?
then, understanding constituents cells, like express
make, developing drugs target cells, not necessarily putting
light-inducing diodes brain, walking around wire packs attached
skull something like that. - [Karl] Right. Exactly. - fantastic. realized no
one crystal ball, think arc is? Meaning, going
see year? two years? Three years? Let reframe that. soon will pill-

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.

see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good

addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see

tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological

maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern

read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer
space, need board one SpaceX missions order access them.
don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't

even medications exist now, know, impulse use

essentially not rigid. element synesthesia, blending senses,
know, feeling colors hearing light things sort. hear reports,
anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis
going on. never reach conscious mind.
something talk "Projections" book quite bit, many
filtered get conscious mind, good. Think distracted

us become aware incomplete hypotheses wrong hypotheses,
concepts might noise just wrong, never allowed get

think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount

world. concept, think it. ways can make
rigorous. can indeed identify brain recording, can see cells
represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one
scientist somebody fellow brain explorer, hits marks rigor
incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

01:16:00 Brain-Machine Interfaces & Neuralink

relatively swift. - exciting. thoughts brain
machine interface Neuralink always comes up, although want point
tremendous respect folks Neuralink including someone came
lab, now neurosurgeon, brain machine interface something
happening long time now, best work, among best work
done Stanford elsewhere course, just described
compatible different brain machine interface, meaning devices, little probes
going stimulate different patterns activity ensembles neurons?
general thoughts brain machine interfaces going forward? - mean, first
all, amazing scientific discovery approach, mentioned, others
Stanford using electrodes, collecting information tens thousands
neurons- - humans, add. Yeah. [chuckles] - even, yes, quite even
separate Neuralink work point out, many people
humans, well non-human primates. pretty powerful, important.
will let us understand going brain, psychiatric disease
neurological disease, will give us ideas treatment. is, course still invasive.
still talking putting device brain. treated
situation risks, step taken carefully. see
something will part psychiatry long run, already deep brain
stimulation approaches, can help people psychiatric disorders. putting
just single electrode, not even complex closed loop system
playing getting information back, even just single stimulation electrode
brain can help people OCD, example, quite powerfully. will become
much powerful get true brain machine interface, collecting
information back, stimulating need to. identify pathological
activity pattern, particular, almost like prodrome early stage seizure,
maybe events happened leading timescale, psychiatric
symptom intervene closed loop way detect happening,
starting go wrong, feed back brain stimulation electrode,


way efficient principled. think great. something
course will grounded causal understanding, need know,
pathological pattern detecting? need know matters.
again, optogenetics helping us. helping us know, okay, pattern
activity cells circuits, mean particular kind
symptom happening. armed knowledge, absolutely, even simple
closed loop device detect stimulate going part psychiatry future.
course, get cells,

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

01:19:30 ADHD & Dr. Deissroth’s Approach Focusing Mind

connections, ability help people will become powerful. -
One questions get asked lot ADHD attention deficit various
kinds. hunch, one reason get asked often people feeling
really distracted challenged funneling attention behavior.
number reasons that, course, true ADHD, look
like? can done it? role channelopsins
downstream technologies developing, offer people
suffer ADHD family member suffers ADHD? - pretty
interesting branch psychiatry. no question people helped
treatments, active debate fraction people
symptoms can treated? - typically Adderall stimulants
kind? - Yeah, example stimulants, right. ADHD name suggests,
symptoms of, can either hyperactive state inattentive state,
can completely separate other. patient effectively
not hyperactive all, can remain focused going around them- -
body can still, mind darting around? - right. - can
hyperactive body. - Yeah, happens ways. - Probably rarely somebody
hyperactive body mind still, [Karl laughs] although say,
benevolent shout Botond Rosca, Botond incredibly sharp
focused mind. - Yeah. - hand movements [Karl laughs] extremely exact also,
sometimes wonder, whether not body movements head
movements, whether not coordinated not readout directed
attention is. - noticed, think complex, abstract thoughts. noticed


still. body almost completely moving think
abstractly deeply. people different. people, running,
get best thoughts. can't even imagine that. brain not work way
all. totally motionless, [laughs] kind interesting. -
go that? - sit much like this, try time day literally
sitting almost position, without distraction thinking, almost
meditative ways, except not true meditation, thinking, well, not
moving- - trying structure thoughts time? - Yeah. - Interesting. -
Yeah. So, everybody, say different. ADHD, key thing
want make sure present across different domains life, school
home, show really pervasive pattern, not something specific
teacher home situation something. can help patients.
interesting ADHD one disorders people trying work
quantitative EEG-based diagnoses, progress toward making
diagnosis looking particular, externally detectable brainwave rhythm- - skullcap
electrodes don't penetrate skull? - right. - can done
hour two-hour session? - Yeah, right. - done clinic, right? -
Yeah, clinic, right, right recording apparatus on,
principle, increase confidence comes exactly measurements one
even imagine moving toward home tests, not yet. - Amazing. think one
reasons get asked much lot people wonder ADHD.
think lifestyle factors inhabit us days, induce
subclinical clinical-like ADHD? look people's phone use including own,
don't think like addiction, looks feels like OCD.
come clean saying younger, kid, grunting tic.
used hide it. actually used hide closet, 'cause dad make stop.
couldn't feel relief mind [grunts] this. actually now,
get tired, pushing long hours, it'll come back. - Interesting. - not
treated it, will confess experience of, always liked sports
involved lot impact, fortunately not football, went high school
football team terrible. Maybe avoided impact, [Karl
laughs] things like skateboarding, boxing, bring relief. feel clarity head
hit, avoid, [Karl laughs] used say time feel truly clear
while. eventually dissipated. age 16, 17, just disappeared.


great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider
perspective, want ask little bit you. first all, realize
partial list, clinician, see patients, run big laboratory,
many people laboratory now? huge laboratory. experience,
can say enormous laboratory. family five children,
happily married wonderful colleague well, incredible work.
organize kind conceptual level, day week? say,
stress mitigation practices any, incorporate? received emails
three morning. sometimes send emails three morning,
wake up, maybe depressed, go back sleep. So, maybe just describe arc
blocks day, not hour hour, necessarily details


blocks, conceptualize day? conceptualize week?
feel lined larger goals making sure
five young people flourish? hear are, go this,
people just overwhelming set items? - Well, course
sometimes just take day day, don't claim- - bring horizon
unit day? - do, do. unit day, right. try
day, mentioned earlier, least hour time can think, can
kids napping, actually, driving can too,
sitting still, [clears throat] one thing try preserve. writing
book, adapted time writing time, wasn't enough, add
new block time sort midnight 2:00 AM, writing time. [chuckles]
carving these, even small protected times important. course, obligations
will expand fill time available disciplined. least found
disciplined truly protecting times one can think. - means no
phone? - means no phone, no checking phone. writing book,
focus mode MacBook kind rules border, just
documents pure, don't temptation distraction. -
big believer vision eyes play prominent role directing
cognition, something talk book, really beautifully, lot
depth rigor, using visual tools harness one's complete mental attention.
practice sitting just thinking, sitting still thinking, said eyes
open. hearing verbal voice, although head? - Yes. -
actually conversation yourself? - Yes. hearing literally, mean, not
quite literally, don't actually hear information, hearing words,
discovered myself. people, think may operate differently,
extremely verbal think. reasoning done. sentences
[chuckles] construction almost equations words. - Complete sentences? -
Complete sentences complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, writing
book, everything writing, every sentence always played mind,
listening rhythm timing, obsess exact placement words get
right rhythm spoken sentence mind. - don't mean interrupt flow,
that, experienced process bit, although differently,
experience kind welling anxiety hitting friction points?
so, tools ways quell anxiety real time? 'Cause


really talking mind. really talking
process converting activity neurons, something physically concrete
world. intermediate steps mysterious everybody. hear, "Just
write book", "Just it", whatever means. fact, statements like
kind empty meaningless, hear voice trying find
correct word keep hitting, doesn't sound quite right, experience
body? - Yeah, not right, definitely evasive, doesn't feel good,
also hope know can solve too, almost like almost
there. path know there, don't quite see it, there.
keep mind, propulsive force forward know
solution there. said, single words spend days on,
just not happy got right. things never
quite got perfect, left book entirely close, not
quite there. like, no, can't put in. - Everything just said entirely
consistent experience you, [both laughing] way go
everything. ask, kids writers? like books words
poetry? know one children going career medicine science. -
Yeah. different amazing, yet all, think
appreciation lot appreciation reading, musical. Two
five extremely musical, very, talented guitar singing vocal,
impressions, just astonishing. great drawing artistry
physical vigorous never happy except leaping
about. so, just amazing different are, honestly. think
shared appreciation language. - think one can train mind using
practices? really like description staying physically still learning
grapple challenges. something that, especially laboratory science,
aren't really trained do. Like many professions taught come just get
motion, found relaxing someone probably underlying
tic [Karl chuckles] something like that, felt great motion. One hardest
things becoming university professor running lab, no longer
working hands. felt like big important part life
amputated. sorts practices incorporate there? think
people can learn get better focusing dedicated practice sort
described? - remember rhythms physical work laboratory well.


work days laboratory leader, job returned mostly words now,
again. kind coming full circle. different mode. think just
embrace different stages life, come different modes, can
definitely train mode. loved, mentioned, rhythm sewing
suturing surgery, worked really hard became good it. now,
never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine

great empathy feel like something contained
won't allow focus want focus on. days, phone
email, et cetera, wonder empathize bit hear people saying
like, "I think might ADHD ADD". think possible behaviors
interaction sensory world, really phones email really
are, induce ADD reactivate it? - great question. think lot,
mentioned tic-like behavior yourself, common people
tics building something can relieved executing
tic can motor movement vocalization even thought. people do,
think days, this. haven't checked phone while,
buildup buildup buildup can check relieve it.
similarities, little reward comes checking. key
question psychiatry, don't diagnose something unless
disrupting call social occupational functioning. Like
number symptoms, literally every psychiatric diagnosis requires
disrupting someone's social occupational functioning. days, checking
phone pretty adaptive. pretty much helps social occupational
functioning. can't make [chuckles] psychiatric diagnosis. - Interesting. -
least world today. - Yeah, opting communication now, makes
ways less adaptive, though point example

01:26:36 Dr. Deisseroth Balances Career Medicine, Science & Family

somebody quite good managing interactions, least outsider

actually conversation yourself? - Yes. hearing literally, mean, not
quite literally, don't actually hear information, hearing words,
discovered myself. people, think may operate differently,
extremely verbal think. reasoning done. sentences
[chuckles] construction almost equations words. - Complete sentences? -
Complete sentences complete-ish anyway, mostly complete, writing

so, tools ways quell anxiety real time? 'Cause


really talking mind. really talking

Yeah. different amazing, yet all, think
appreciation lot appreciation reading, musical. Two
five extremely musical, very, talented guitar singing vocal,

physical vigorous never happy except leaping
about. so, just amazing different are, honestly. think
shared appreciation language. - think one can train mind using
practices? really like description staying physically still learning
grapple challenges. something that, especially laboratory science,
aren't really trained do. Like many professions taught come just get
motion, found relaxing someone probably underlying
tic [Karl chuckles] something like that, felt great motion. One hardest
things becoming university professor running lab, no longer
working hands. felt like big important part life
amputated. sorts practices incorporate there? think
people can learn get better focusing dedicated practice sort
described? - remember rhythms physical work laboratory well.


work days laboratory leader, job returned mostly words now,
again. kind coming full circle. different mode. think just
embrace different stages life, come different modes, can
definitely train mode. loved, mentioned, rhythm sewing
suturing surgery, worked really hard became good it. now,
never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise

combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just

activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins
much. - certainly helped field neuroscience medicine
mention, know people various sensitivities animal research,
work carried

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric

wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going

explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections
DEA on. - anyone's hoping find labs, [Karl laughing] exist outer

don't try come find them. - No, exactly true. Yes. exactly
this. saying incredible opportunity. understand
perception reality altered, creating new kinds intervention don't

even medications exist now, know, impulse use

anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,

something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities

reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns

taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,

essentially not rigid. element synesthesia, blending senses,
know, feeling colors hearing light things sort. hear reports,
anyway. dream-like experience somehow relieve depression,
long-term? idea might be? - Yeah. ideas,
no deep understanding. One way think psychedelics increase
willingness to... increase willingness brain accept unlikely ways
constructing world, unlikely hypothesis, were, going on. brain,
particular cortex, think, hypothesis generation testing machine.
coming models everything. got lot bits data coming in,
making models updating models changing them, theories, hypothesis
going on. never reach conscious mind.
something talk "Projections" book quite bit, many
filtered get conscious mind, good. Think distracted

us become aware incomplete hypotheses wrong hypotheses,
concepts might noise just wrong, never allowed get
conscious mind. Now, pretty interesting, goes wrong psychiatric disorders.
think schizophrenia times paranoid delusions people
examples poor models escape conscious mind
become accepted reality never should've gotten there. Now,
something like right way, help something like depression? Patients
depression often stuck. can't look future world possibilities
effectively. Everything seems hopeless. really mean? discount
value action, discount value world giving rise
future matters. Everything seems run like river just running desert


drying up, agents may increase flow circuitry,
will, percolation activity circuitry may end depression
increasing escape tendrils process forward progression
world. concept, think it. ways can make
rigorous. can indeed identify brain recording, can see cells
represent steps along path look future, can rigorously define
cells can see altered psychedelics. one
reasons working agents laboratory say, right,
really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful
treatment trauma, PTSD similar things. work? larger
question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience
them, effect after. People generating
variations compounds non-hallucinatory variations. But, crucial
think have, stay MDMA, experience huge levels dopamine,
huge levels serotonin, atypical levels dopamine serotonin released,
highly abnormal experience order normal again? - Yeah. think brain learns
experiences. way see it, example, people
taken MDMA, say, will acute phase drug
experiencing extreme connectedness people example,
drug wears off, brain learned experience. people will
report is, yeah, not state, saw possible. saw it. Yeah.
don't need barriers, least not many barriers thought. can connect
people way helpful. think learning happens


state, actually matters. - described that, sounds lot like
understand hallmark feature really good psychoanalysis, relationship
patient therapist, hopefully evolves point kinds tests
can run within context relationship, exported relations. -
Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

try help patients create new model stable, learned, can help
instruct future behavior. - One things took reading book,
addition learning much science future psychiatry brain science was,
amidst tragic cases sadness, lot weight puts
clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two

Yeah. different amazing, yet all, think
appreciation lot appreciation reading, musical. Two
five extremely musical, very, talented guitar singing vocal,
impressions, just astonishing. great drawing artistry
physical vigorous never happy except leaping
about. so, just amazing different are, honestly. think
shared appreciation language. - think one can train mind using
practices? really like description staying physically still learning
grapple challenges. something that, especially laboratory science,
aren't really trained do. Like many professions taught come just get
motion, found relaxing someone probably underlying
tic [Karl chuckles] something like that, felt great motion. One hardest
things becoming university professor running lab, no longer
working hands. felt like big important part life
amputated. sorts practices incorporate there? think
people can learn get better focusing dedicated practice sort
described? - remember rhythms physical work laboratory well.


work days laboratory leader, job returned mostly words now,
again. kind coming full circle. different mode. think just
embrace different stages life, come different modes, can
definitely train mode. loved, mentioned, rhythm sewing
suturing surgery, worked really hard became good it. now,
never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things
absorbing scattering light gone, can brain completely
transparent, yet, interesting molecules still locked place there,
cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within
tissue anchoring molecules place. - Literally glass-clear brains. done
this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.

optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain

amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins

01:46:03 Psychedelics

mice absolutely vital instructional treatment human disease. -
right. - Since talked dissociation dissociative states rather
ketamine, love thoughts psychedelic medicine. know, sort half joke

read history books, happened before. movement aimed taking
compounds essentially, putting patients people
obviously using recreationally, putting patients, seeing
tremendous positive effects, also tremendous examples induced psychiatric
illness. words, many people lost minds consequence overuse
psychedelics. probably lose people there, want talk about,
state compounds? realize huge category compounds, LSD
psilocybin, understand trigger activation particular serotonin receptor
mechanisms, may may not lead widespread activation brain one
wouldn't see otherwise. look clinical experimental literature,
sort top contour sense effective tools going
treating depression? time, talk trauma
MDMA work. - Well, right highlight opportunity
parallel there. course want help patients course want
explore anything might helpful, want safe rigorous way.
think explore avenues. agents alter reality
alter experience reality say, relatively precise ways.
problems, can addictive, can cause lasting change not desirable,
see opportunities. first all, study laboratory,
here. know [chuckles] big... safes many
interesting psychedelics carefully regulated. get inspections

really case?

01:54:12 MDMA

opening new paths representations paths future? - MDMA,
ecstasy unique compound leads big increases brain levels
dopamine serotonin simultaneously. realized neuromodulators like
dopamine serotonin often work concert, not alone, way commonly
described general popular discussions. However, unique compound,
different serotonergic compounds, like LSD psilocybin.
now data, still emerging might be, cases can useful

question, perhaps important question is, psychedelics, MDMA, LSD,
compounds, mind two components. experience

Exactly right. Yeah. - probably, assuming still goal really good
psychiatry also. - part of- - Intimacy, really. - be. time,
think good psychiatrists try achieve level connection learning,

01:57:15 Dr. Deisseroth’s New Book “Projections: Story Emotions”

clinician, also, central cord optimism, headed
not just possible likely, better. - Yeah. - And, optimist? -
[chuckles] am. way, really interesting experience writing
"Projections", dual goal. wanted everybody, literally
everybody world wants read it. yet time, wanted stay
absolutely rigorously close science, actually known,
speaking science. speaking neurobiology brain
psychiatry, wanted not scientific colleagues think, oh, going
far, saying much. two goals kept mind
entire time. lot trying find exactly right word talked was,
path staying excruciatingly rigorous science yet, letting people see
hope, things were, everybody see come long way,
long way go, trajectory path beautiful. goal,
think. course sounds almost impossible [chuckles] jointly satisfy two
goals, kept mind whole way through. yes, optimistic
hope came book - certainly did, least colleague,
achieve both. wonderful, masterful book, really, one

incredibly interesting ton storytelling.

work days laboratory leader, job returned mostly words now,
again. kind coming full circle. different mode. think just
embrace different stages life, come different modes, can
definitely train mode. loved, mentioned, rhythm sewing
suturing surgery, worked really hard became good it. now,
never it, next challenge. various experimental
techniques dissections brain,

01:35:41 New Ways Exploring Brains: CLARITY

can't tell many thousands brain dissections done life, now
don't all. [Karl laughs] - developed method don't
dissect brains. - right. [chuckles] - mentioned there, maybe tell us
moment clarity, people will probably never set foot
laboratory, incredible, yet another incredible discovery development clarity
is, helps us understand brain structured. - Yeah.
different technology also developed lab here, part broader approach
call hydrogel-tissue chemistry. is, building gel, like clear
jello-like substance within cells tissue even animal, once.
effectively building gel inside cells once. Now, odd thing
do. it? Well, transform tissue tractable
accessible object. reason works built gel, new
infrastructure inside tissue, can use chemical tricks, can link
molecules care about, like proteins RNAs things, know, right
become proteins, can link them, physically anchor gel,
scaffold basically, interlocking network polymers. can link
interesting molecules place, lock initially tissue,
cell, cells. can remove vigorously, everything don't care
blocking light, blocking molecules, coming exchange
information tissue. can get rid everything else, like lipids, fats,
can effectively use detergents get out, can see things

cellular sub cellular level. hydrogel-tissue chemistry. first form


described called clarity. use quite bit still, many variants
now, others developed basic concept building gel within

this, taken brain cleared method, looked somebody it, [Karl
laughing] although don't want get close eye, don't want
touch eye, can see direct way it. - [Karl] Yeah. -
incredible raises important question, again, human
brain, somebody essentially started neuroanatomy got
things, always bothered fact actually know little
microstructure human brain, compared brains organisms. - Yeah. -
thinking understanding circuitry

01:38:49 Special Human Brain?

piano, speak manipulate order relieve suffering, one
wonders, structures animal brains behave, active
coping, passive coping, ADD, et cetera, models, well translate
human condition. think fair say entire regions human
brain aren't just bigger, exist brains humans? Especially given
speech, although wonder sometimes animals report
there. Maybe little psychiatric sessions one another. - know,
always careful not assume things better. certainly understand
better understand animals doing, certainly
things better do. said, amazing, wonderful brains many
structures highly developed brains not nearly developed
mice fish example. Now, said, look big picture,
mammalian brain really doing? things never thought
study animals laboratory mammals like mice, turns can,
actually, never draw line say, something can't study
mice, something no parallel mice. careful
making statement like that. good example able study
just past year, come understanding dissociation, paper
came late 2020, mouse human work, got sort
circuit basis dissociation. Now, dissociation? lot people might not


experienced it, actually common. 70% people who've
trauma experience dissociation, shows borderline personality, shows
PTSD. is, separation sense self, body. can
someone who, not numb, not anesthetized. can still
know something's happening body, just don't care, don't
ascribe yourself, interesting, right? interesting that? - cells
report narrative. - Yeah. Yeah. - book, touch this. will say
precise, meaningful eloquent description might consciousness,
narrative toward self self, might reside. dissociative
conditions, people feeling kind absence merge mind body.
- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
like psychiatric conditions can cause it. able manifest
mice, administering dissociative agents mice. make still able
detect stimulus, not care happening. recording
activity individual cells brain see going on, happening
along dissociation, use optogenetics see mattered actually
provide pattern activity see, oh, actually causes dissociation.
mice, would've thought study something like
mice? able go back forth human work
Stanford Comprehensive Epilepsy Center, lot call Stereo EEG
Recording. Patients come course normal clinical care,
electrodes recording brain identify seizure is, can
candidates removing little patch brain causing seizure.
done patients medications not helping seizure disorder.
patient dissociative state every seizure, human
really dissociating, tell us literally happening.
see pattern, pattern happening mice, patch
brain, see happening human exactly right time,
patch brain homologous across immense evolutionary
distances. knew mattered mouse human
human cause happen. - just want underscore power


optogenetics ability not just remove particular experience behavior
lesioning destroying, go back actually activate structure
group structures see emergences. essentially, days hear lot
gain function research context viral manipulation, gain function
something laboratory patients, take away
something put back, gives causality. - right. Yeah, exactly.
optogenetics, able provide animals without
ketamine drug cause dissociative state playing precise
pattern activity. thought that?
combined mouse human paper. Likewise, able play visual
sensations brains mice, observing cells visual part
brain, visual cortex, naturally responsive example, vertical bars, instead
horizontal bars visual world, see cells normally reporting
vertical bars, use optogenetics come play activity just
cells. - animals not viewing anything? - Not viewing anything all.
activate just vertical bar cells, not animal act
seeing vertical bar, behaviorally, trained particular thing saw
vertical bar, that, just seeing something visually. everything
brain recording internal representation external world
naturalistic too. looked like brain seeing something visual. gain
function too, know, playing in, providing complex sensation percept wasn't
before. can across species. So, course mice social,
amazing acts information processing try not disparage cousins

- Right. - one way describe it? - right. - recall, paper
involved exploration ketamine. - Ketamine big part it. Yeah, right.
ketamine another one cases people can experience
dissociation. Ketamine PCP, call dissociative drugs. cause just
