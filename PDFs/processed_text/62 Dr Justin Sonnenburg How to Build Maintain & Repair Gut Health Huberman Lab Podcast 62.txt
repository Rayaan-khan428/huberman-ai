00:08:30 Gut Microbiome?

two free pillows. now discussion Dr. Justin Sonnenburg. Justin,
thanks much here. - Great here. - Yeah. true novice
comes microbiome, like start off really basic question, is,
microbiome? imagine lots little bugs running around gut don't
quite like image that, aware microbiome can good us,
can also unhealthy microbiome. look microbiome
scale see meaningful things, look like, going
there? - Yeah, mean essentially correct. mean, little
microorganisms running around gut. think, just start off clarifying
terminology, microbiome microbiota quite often referred to, used refer
microbial community interchangeably, probably switch two
terms today. important thing realize microbes not just
gut, body. nose, mouths,
skin. basically anywhere environment can get body,


includes inside digestive tract, course, colonized microbes.
vast majority distal gut colon, gut
microbiota gut microbiome. density community astounding. mean,
really is. get scale able see individual microbes, start
off zoomed view see something looks like fecal material
digest inside gut, zoom in, start get microscopic level
see microbes. just packed side side, end end. super dense
bacterial community, almost like biofilm, something just made microbes,
point thought around 30% fecal matter microbes, 30 50%.
incredibly dense microbial community, talking trillions microbial cells.
microbial cells, start get know them, see are,
break gut probably hundreds, 1,000 species, depending upon
define microbial species. bacteria, lot
life forms there. archaea, little microbes bacterial-like,
different. eukaryotes. commonly think eukaryotes gut
something like parasite. eukaryotes, fungi, also
little viruses. bacteriophages infect bacterial cells.
actually outnumber bacteria, like 10 one. just everywhere there, kill
bacteria. really interesting predator/prey interactions. overall,
just really dense, complex, dynamic ecosystem. so, talking
human single species, also thinking human complex,
integrated ecosystem hundreds thousands species, interacting concert
fantastic things know happen human body. - Amazing. got
lot cargo. maybe cargo. - Yeah. - knows? - Yeah, mean,
people likened humans just really elaborate culturing flask
microbes, actually designed course evolution, designed
just efficiently propagate microbial culture person person, generation
generation.

00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability

different way thinking human body. - Interesting. believe pH
pH digestive system varies descend, go mouth throat
stomach. said microbiota distal colon.


distinct forms microbiota along length digestive tract, within
interfaces outside world? - Totally. Yeah. starts teeth
mouth, saliva, oral microbiota. microbial species
different ones find digestive tract. usually built deal
oxygen well. area exposed lot oxygen,
course see different nutrients than, instance, colonic bacteria see.
grow quite often mats live teeth. structured terms of...
not moving around lot. very, fairly stationary. move
digestive tract, microbes esophagus stomach, communities
not dense, actually not well studied. know very...
famous stomach bacteria known Helicobacter pylori, can cause stomach
ulcers cause gastric cancer less frequent situations.
different set microbes, adapted different environment,
stomach especially, incredibly acidic environment. also different terms
ability interact microbes, just communities less dense,
less dynamic, less nutrients stay passage
community. lot times communities reliant upon nutrients derived
host, opposed nutrients derived diet. move
stomach, small intestine, start see communities, ones
becoming well-studied. Small intestine still bit black box, just
hard access. really cool technologies
using, instance, capsules sampling capsule passes digestive
tract, better idea going small intestine.
get colon, community just incredibly densely packed,
ton of... ton metabolic activity happening there, bunch
interaction host. community really best studied. Part
reason stool easy obtain compared to, instance,
something stomach small intestine. stool fairly representative,
know, studies done using colonoscopies forth. Stool fairly
representative happening colon. dense, super exciting community,
also best studied, just easiest access

00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets



lower digestive tract. - interesting. imagine microbiota get
point, microbiota seen newborns? words,
come from? dare ask, direction enter body? multiple
directions? - Yeah, yeah. Great question. one burning questions can
come back end this, microbiota come from?
kind existential question field, like community assembling
from? reason interesting question that, fetus,
womb, actually sterile environment. studies
looked whether microbes womb, microbes colonizing fetus
point. debate this, overall looks like not big part
equation microbial colonization. time infant born,
new ecosystem. like island rising ocean no species it,
suddenly land rush open territory. know infants go
really complex process microbiota assembly first days, weeks,
months, years life. get switching solid food, two three years
age. changes childhood, adolescence, working adulthood.
first zero one year super dynamic time really kind stereotypical
developmental changes gut microbiota, appear possibility going
wrong causing problems infants instances. step away
extreme side things going wrong, also lot different trajectories
developmental process can take, microbiota malleable plastic,
trajectories can affected sorts factors early life. example
whether infant born C-section born vaginally. know beautiful work
done field infants born C-section actually gut
microbiota looks like human skin like either birth canal,
vagina microbiota, mother's stool microbiota. Babies born
birth canal initial colonization vaginal microbes stool microbes
mother. just first days, whether born C-section natural
childbirth, gut microbiota looks different. compound top that,
whether breast fed formula fed, whether family pet doesn't
pet, whether exposed antibiotics, factors really can
change developmental process, really change microbial identity, eventually
life. reason field paying really close attention studying
right now know animal studies, depending upon microbes


get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

00:08:30 Gut Microbiome?

two free pillows. now discussion Dr. Justin Sonnenburg. Justin,
thanks much here. - Great here. - Yeah. true novice
comes microbiome, like start off really basic question, is,
microbiome? imagine lots little bugs running around gut don't
quite like image that, aware microbiome can good us,
can also unhealthy microbiome. look microbiome
scale see meaningful things, look like, going
there? - Yeah, mean essentially correct. mean, little
microorganisms running around gut. think, just start off clarifying
terminology, microbiome microbiota quite often referred to, used refer
microbial community interchangeably, probably switch two
terms today. important thing realize microbes not just
gut, body. nose, mouths,
skin. basically anywhere environment can get body,


includes inside digestive tract, course, colonized microbes.
vast majority distal gut colon, gut
microbiota gut microbiome. density community astounding. mean,
really is. get scale able see individual microbes, start
off zoomed view see something looks like fecal material
digest inside gut, zoom in, start get microscopic level
see microbes. just packed side side, end end. super dense
bacterial community, almost like biofilm, something just made microbes,
point thought around 30% fecal matter microbes, 30 50%.
incredibly dense microbial community, talking trillions microbial cells.
microbial cells, start get know them, see are,
break gut probably hundreds, 1,000 species, depending upon
define microbial species. bacteria, lot
life forms there. archaea, little microbes bacterial-like,
different. eukaryotes. commonly think eukaryotes gut
something like parasite. eukaryotes, fungi, also
little viruses. bacteriophages infect bacterial cells.
actually outnumber bacteria, like 10 one. just everywhere there, kill
bacteria. really interesting predator/prey interactions. overall,
just really dense, complex, dynamic ecosystem. so, talking
human single species, also thinking human complex,
integrated ecosystem hundreds thousands species, interacting concert
fantastic things know happen human body. - Amazing. got
lot cargo. maybe cargo. - Yeah. - knows? - Yeah, mean,
people likened humans just really elaborate culturing flask
microbes, actually designed course evolution, designed
just efficiently propagate microbial culture person person, generation
generation.

00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability

different way thinking human body. - Interesting. believe pH
pH digestive system varies descend, go mouth throat
stomach. said microbiota distal colon.


distinct forms microbiota along length digestive tract, within
interfaces outside world? - Totally. Yeah. starts teeth
mouth, saliva, oral microbiota. microbial species
different ones find digestive tract. usually built deal
oxygen well. area exposed lot oxygen,
course see different nutrients than, instance, colonic bacteria see.
grow quite often mats live teeth. structured terms of...
not moving around lot. very, fairly stationary. move
digestive tract, microbes esophagus stomach, communities
not dense, actually not well studied. know very...
famous stomach bacteria known Helicobacter pylori, can cause stomach
ulcers cause gastric cancer less frequent situations.
different set microbes, adapted different environment,
stomach especially, incredibly acidic environment. also different terms
ability interact microbes, just communities less dense,
less dynamic, less nutrients stay passage
community. lot times communities reliant upon nutrients derived
host, opposed nutrients derived diet. move
stomach, small intestine, start see communities, ones
becoming well-studied. Small intestine still bit black box, just
hard access. really cool technologies
using, instance, capsules sampling capsule passes digestive
tract, better idea going small intestine.
get colon, community just incredibly densely packed,
ton of... ton metabolic activity happening there, bunch
interaction host. community really best studied. Part
reason stool easy obtain compared to, instance,
something stomach small intestine. stool fairly representative,
know, studies done using colonoscopies forth. Stool fairly
representative happening colon. dense, super exciting community,
also best studied, just easiest access

00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets



lower digestive tract. - interesting. imagine microbiota get
point, microbiota seen newborns? words,
come from? dare ask, direction enter body? multiple
directions? - Yeah, yeah. Great question. one burning questions can
come back end this, microbiota come from?
kind existential question field, like community assembling
from? reason interesting question that, fetus,
womb, actually sterile environment. studies
looked whether microbes womb, microbes colonizing fetus
point. debate this, overall looks like not big part
equation microbial colonization. time infant born,
new ecosystem. like island rising ocean no species it,
suddenly land rush open territory. know infants go
really complex process microbiota assembly first days, weeks,
months, years life. get switching solid food, two three years
age. changes childhood, adolescence, working adulthood.
first zero one year super dynamic time really kind stereotypical
developmental changes gut microbiota, appear possibility going
wrong causing problems infants instances. step away
extreme side things going wrong, also lot different trajectories
developmental process can take, microbiota malleable plastic,
trajectories can affected sorts factors early life. example
whether infant born C-section born vaginally. know beautiful work
done field infants born C-section actually gut
microbiota looks like human skin like either birth canal,
vagina microbiota, mother's stool microbiota. Babies born
birth canal initial colonization vaginal microbes stool microbes
mother. just first days, whether born C-section natural
childbirth, gut microbiota looks different. compound top that,
whether breast fed formula fed, whether family pet doesn't
pet, whether exposed antibiotics, factors really can
change developmental process, really change microbial identity, eventually
life. reason field paying really close attention studying
right now know animal studies, depending upon microbes


get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

00:08:30 Gut Microbiome?

two free pillows. now discussion Dr. Justin Sonnenburg. Justin,
thanks much here. - Great here. - Yeah. true novice
comes microbiome, like start off really basic question, is,
microbiome? imagine lots little bugs running around gut don't
quite like image that, aware microbiome can good us,
can also unhealthy microbiome. look microbiome
scale see meaningful things, look like, going
there? - Yeah, mean essentially correct. mean, little
microorganisms running around gut. think, just start off clarifying
terminology, microbiome microbiota quite often referred to, used refer
microbial community interchangeably, probably switch two
terms today. important thing realize microbes not just
gut, body. nose, mouths,
skin. basically anywhere environment can get body,


includes inside digestive tract, course, colonized microbes.
vast majority distal gut colon, gut
microbiota gut microbiome. density community astounding. mean,
really is. get scale able see individual microbes, start
off zoomed view see something looks like fecal material
digest inside gut, zoom in, start get microscopic level
see microbes. just packed side side, end end. super dense
bacterial community, almost like biofilm, something just made microbes,
point thought around 30% fecal matter microbes, 30 50%.
incredibly dense microbial community, talking trillions microbial cells.
microbial cells, start get know them, see are,
break gut probably hundreds, 1,000 species, depending upon
define microbial species. bacteria, lot
life forms there. archaea, little microbes bacterial-like,
different. eukaryotes. commonly think eukaryotes gut
something like parasite. eukaryotes, fungi, also
little viruses. bacteriophages infect bacterial cells.
actually outnumber bacteria, like 10 one. just everywhere there, kill
bacteria. really interesting predator/prey interactions. overall,
just really dense, complex, dynamic ecosystem. so, talking
human single species, also thinking human complex,
integrated ecosystem hundreds thousands species, interacting concert
fantastic things know happen human body. - Amazing. got
lot cargo. maybe cargo. - Yeah. - knows? - Yeah, mean,
people likened humans just really elaborate culturing flask
microbes, actually designed course evolution, designed
just efficiently propagate microbial culture person person, generation
generation.

00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability

different way thinking human body. - Interesting. believe pH
pH digestive system varies descend, go mouth throat
stomach. said microbiota distal colon.


distinct forms microbiota along length digestive tract, within
interfaces outside world? - Totally. Yeah. starts teeth
mouth, saliva, oral microbiota. microbial species
different ones find digestive tract. usually built deal
oxygen well. area exposed lot oxygen,
course see different nutrients than, instance, colonic bacteria see.
grow quite often mats live teeth. structured terms of...
not moving around lot. very, fairly stationary. move
digestive tract, microbes esophagus stomach, communities
not dense, actually not well studied. know very...
famous stomach bacteria known Helicobacter pylori, can cause stomach
ulcers cause gastric cancer less frequent situations.
different set microbes, adapted different environment,
stomach especially, incredibly acidic environment. also different terms
ability interact microbes, just communities less dense,
less dynamic, less nutrients stay passage
community. lot times communities reliant upon nutrients derived
host, opposed nutrients derived diet. move
stomach, small intestine, start see communities, ones
becoming well-studied. Small intestine still bit black box, just
hard access. really cool technologies
using, instance, capsules sampling capsule passes digestive
tract, better idea going small intestine.
get colon, community just incredibly densely packed,
ton of... ton metabolic activity happening there, bunch
interaction host. community really best studied. Part
reason stool easy obtain compared to, instance,
something stomach small intestine. stool fairly representative,
know, studies done using colonoscopies forth. Stool fairly
representative happening colon. dense, super exciting community,
also best studied, just easiest access

00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets



lower digestive tract. - interesting. imagine microbiota get
point, microbiota seen newborns? words,
come from? dare ask, direction enter body? multiple
directions? - Yeah, yeah. Great question. one burning questions can
come back end this, microbiota come from?
kind existential question field, like community assembling
from? reason interesting question that, fetus,
womb, actually sterile environment. studies
looked whether microbes womb, microbes colonizing fetus
point. debate this, overall looks like not big part
equation microbial colonization. time infant born,
new ecosystem. like island rising ocean no species it,
suddenly land rush open territory. know infants go
really complex process microbiota assembly first days, weeks,
months, years life. get switching solid food, two three years
age. changes childhood, adolescence, working adulthood.
first zero one year super dynamic time really kind stereotypical
developmental changes gut microbiota, appear possibility going
wrong causing problems infants instances. step away
extreme side things going wrong, also lot different trajectories
developmental process can take, microbiota malleable plastic,
trajectories can affected sorts factors early life. example
whether infant born C-section born vaginally. know beautiful work
done field infants born C-section actually gut
microbiota looks like human skin like either birth canal,
vagina microbiota, mother's stool microbiota. Babies born
birth canal initial colonization vaginal microbes stool microbes
mother. just first days, whether born C-section natural
childbirth, gut microbiota looks different. compound top that,
whether breast fed formula fed, whether family pet doesn't
pet, whether exposed antibiotics, factors really can
change developmental process, really change microbial identity, eventually
life. reason field paying really close attention studying
right now know animal studies, depending upon microbes


get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

includes inside digestive tract, course, colonized microbes.
vast majority distal gut colon, gut
microbiota gut microbiome. density community astounding. mean,
really is. get scale able see individual microbes, start
off zoomed view see something looks like fecal material
digest inside gut, zoom in, start get microscopic level
see microbes. just packed side side, end end. super dense
bacterial community, almost like biofilm, something just made microbes,
point thought around 30% fecal matter microbes, 30 50%.
incredibly dense microbial community, talking trillions microbial cells.
microbial cells, start get know them, see are,
break gut probably hundreds, 1,000 species, depending upon
define microbial species. bacteria, lot
life forms there. archaea, little microbes bacterial-like,
different. eukaryotes. commonly think eukaryotes gut
something like parasite. eukaryotes, fungi, also
little viruses. bacteriophages infect bacterial cells.
actually outnumber bacteria, like 10 one. just everywhere there, kill
bacteria. really interesting predator/prey interactions. overall,
just really dense, complex, dynamic ecosystem. so, talking
human single species, also thinking human complex,
integrated ecosystem hundreds thousands species, interacting concert
fantastic things know happen human body. - Amazing. got
lot cargo. maybe cargo. - Yeah. - knows? - Yeah, mean,
people likened humans just really elaborate culturing flask
microbes, actually designed course evolution, designed
just efficiently propagate microbial culture person person, generation
generation.

00:12:49 Gastrointestinal (GI) Tract & Microbiota Variability

different way thinking human body. - Interesting. believe pH
pH digestive system varies descend, go mouth throat
stomach. said microbiota distal colon.


distinct forms microbiota along length digestive tract, within
interfaces outside world? - Totally. Yeah. starts teeth
mouth, saliva, oral microbiota. microbial species
different ones find digestive tract. usually built deal
oxygen well. area exposed lot oxygen,
course see different nutrients than, instance, colonic bacteria see.
grow quite often mats live teeth. structured terms of...
not moving around lot. very, fairly stationary. move
digestive tract, microbes esophagus stomach, communities
not dense, actually not well studied. know very...
famous stomach bacteria known Helicobacter pylori, can cause stomach
ulcers cause gastric cancer less frequent situations.
different set microbes, adapted different environment,
stomach especially, incredibly acidic environment. also different terms
ability interact microbes, just communities less dense,
less dynamic, less nutrients stay passage
community. lot times communities reliant upon nutrients derived
host, opposed nutrients derived diet. move
stomach, small intestine, start see communities, ones
becoming well-studied. Small intestine still bit black box, just
hard access. really cool technologies
using, instance, capsules sampling capsule passes digestive
tract, better idea going small intestine.
get colon, community just incredibly densely packed,
ton of... ton metabolic activity happening there, bunch
interaction host. community really best studied. Part
reason stool easy obtain compared to, instance,
something stomach small intestine. stool fairly representative,
know, studies done using colonoscopies forth. Stool fairly
representative happening colon. dense, super exciting community,
also best studied, just easiest access

00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets



lower digestive tract. - interesting. imagine microbiota get
point, microbiota seen newborns? words,
come from? dare ask, direction enter body? multiple
directions? - Yeah, yeah. Great question. one burning questions can
come back end this, microbiota come from?
kind existential question field, like community assembling
from? reason interesting question that, fetus,
womb, actually sterile environment. studies
looked whether microbes womb, microbes colonizing fetus
point. debate this, overall looks like not big part
equation microbial colonization. time infant born,
new ecosystem. like island rising ocean no species it,
suddenly land rush open territory. know infants go
really complex process microbiota assembly first days, weeks,
months, years life. get switching solid food, two three years
age. changes childhood, adolescence, working adulthood.
first zero one year super dynamic time really kind stereotypical
developmental changes gut microbiota, appear possibility going
wrong causing problems infants instances. step away
extreme side things going wrong, also lot different trajectories
developmental process can take, microbiota malleable plastic,
trajectories can affected sorts factors early life. example
whether infant born C-section born vaginally. know beautiful work
done field infants born C-section actually gut
microbiota looks like human skin like either birth canal,
vagina microbiota, mother's stool microbiota. Babies born
birth canal initial colonization vaginal microbes stool microbes
mother. just first days, whether born C-section natural
childbirth, gut microbiota looks different. compound top that,
whether breast fed formula fed, whether family pet doesn't
pet, whether exposed antibiotics, factors really can
change developmental process, really change microbial identity, eventually
life. reason field paying really close attention studying
right now know animal studies, depending upon microbes


get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

distinct forms microbiota along length digestive tract, within
interfaces outside world? - Totally. Yeah. starts teeth
mouth, saliva, oral microbiota. microbial species
different ones find digestive tract. usually built deal
oxygen well. area exposed lot oxygen,
course see different nutrients than, instance, colonic bacteria see.
grow quite often mats live teeth. structured terms of...
not moving around lot. very, fairly stationary. move
digestive tract, microbes esophagus stomach, communities
not dense, actually not well studied. know very...
famous stomach bacteria known Helicobacter pylori, can cause stomach
ulcers cause gastric cancer less frequent situations.
different set microbes, adapted different environment,
stomach especially, incredibly acidic environment. also different terms
ability interact microbes, just communities less dense,
less dynamic, less nutrients stay passage
community. lot times communities reliant upon nutrients derived
host, opposed nutrients derived diet. move
stomach, small intestine, start see communities, ones
becoming well-studied. Small intestine still bit black box, just
hard access. really cool technologies
using, instance, capsules sampling capsule passes digestive
tract, better idea going small intestine.
get colon, community just incredibly densely packed,
ton of... ton metabolic activity happening there, bunch
interaction host. community really best studied. Part
reason stool easy obtain compared to, instance,
something stomach small intestine. stool fairly representative,
know, studies done using colonoscopies forth. Stool fairly
representative happening colon. dense, super exciting community,
also best studied, just easiest access

00:16:00 Breast Feeding, C-Sections & Pets



lower digestive tract. - interesting. imagine microbiota get
point, microbiota seen newborns? words,
come from? dare ask, direction enter body? multiple
directions? - Yeah, yeah. Great question. one burning questions can
come back end this, microbiota come from?
kind existential question field, like community assembling
from? reason interesting question that, fetus,
womb, actually sterile environment. studies
looked whether microbes womb, microbes colonizing fetus
point. debate this, overall looks like not big part
equation microbial colonization. time infant born,
new ecosystem. like island rising ocean no species it,
suddenly land rush open territory. know infants go
really complex process microbiota assembly first days, weeks,
months, years life. get switching solid food, two three years
age. changes childhood, adolescence, working adulthood.
first zero one year super dynamic time really kind stereotypical
developmental changes gut microbiota, appear possibility going
wrong causing problems infants instances. step away
extreme side things going wrong, also lot different trajectories
developmental process can take, microbiota malleable plastic,
trajectories can affected sorts factors early life. example
whether infant born C-section born vaginally. know beautiful work
done field infants born C-section actually gut
microbiota looks like human skin like either birth canal,
vagina microbiota, mother's stool microbiota. Babies born
birth canal initial colonization vaginal microbes stool microbes
mother. just first days, whether born C-section natural
childbirth, gut microbiota looks different. compound top that,
whether breast fed formula fed, whether family pet doesn't
pet, whether exposed antibiotics, factors really can
change developmental process, really change microbial identity, eventually
life. reason field paying really close attention studying
right now know animal studies, depending upon microbes


get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like

inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

come from? dare ask, direction enter body? multiple
directions? - Yeah, yeah. Great question. one burning questions can
come back end this, microbiota come from?
kind existential question field, like community assembling
from? reason interesting question that, fetus,
womb, actually sterile environment. studies
looked whether microbes womb, microbes colonizing fetus
point. debate this, overall looks like not big part
equation microbial colonization. time infant born,
new ecosystem. like island rising ocean no species it,
suddenly land rush open territory. know infants go
really complex process microbiota assembly first days, weeks,
months, years life. get switching solid food, two three years
age. changes childhood, adolescence, working adulthood.
first zero one year super dynamic time really kind stereotypical
developmental changes gut microbiota, appear possibility going
wrong causing problems infants instances. step away
extreme side things going wrong, also lot different trajectories
developmental process can take, microbiota malleable plastic,
trajectories can affected sorts factors early life. example
whether infant born C-section born vaginally. know beautiful work
done field infants born C-section actually gut
microbiota looks like human skin like either birth canal,
vagina microbiota, mother's stool microbiota. Babies born
birth canal initial colonization vaginal microbes stool microbes
mother. just first days, whether born C-section natural
childbirth, gut microbiota looks different. compound top that,
whether breast fed formula fed, whether family pet doesn't
pet, whether exposed antibiotics, factors really can
change developmental process, really change microbial identity, eventually
life. reason field paying really close attention studying
right now know animal studies, depending upon microbes


get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

get early life, can send immune system metabolism organism
parts biology totally different developmental trajectories.
microbes colonized early life can really change biology, can
come back later, but- - Yeah, should. - Getting back original question
microbes come from, think born
mother's birth canal, exposed skin microbes, lot microbes
come mother, actually turns that, can certainly detect signal,
certainly see maternal microbes infant, lot microbes
coming places, surfaces, people, perhaps caregivers, perhaps
strangers well. acquire microbes variety sources. first ones
mom, caregivers hospital, add
tremendously first year life. - Incredible, even said pets.
dog home parakeet home, clearly microbiome
also, potentially child deriving microbiota species pets, correct? -
Exactly, yeah. best studies done just looked pets
household factor, whether changes group infants pet
look slightly different group infants don't pet.
question is, pet change microbes? probably
actually contributing, direct members microbiota. Actually, dog, dog
occasionally will lick mouth without paying attention, probably
introducing microbes. also know pets dirt, outside,
exposed lot environmental microbes. just pets serving
conduit bunch microbes wouldn't otherwise come contact
possibility well. - Well, will return pets, particular dog, amazing
dog, way. met dog just day, force myself, pry
away from... Havanese, right? - Havanese. - [Andrew Huberman] Incredible.
dog's name? - Louis. Louis Pasteur. - Louis Pasteur. - Yeah, yeah.

00:21:56 Human Microbiome Project Stanford

- appropriate. Amazing dog, personality dog. - Yeah. - issue
think lot people probably wondering is, healthy microbiome?
supporting? hear need healthy microbiome support immune
system metabolism, even gut-brain axis. define healthy, versus


unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

unhealthy microbiome? people might know unhealthy microbiome dysbiosis
word encounter literature. given many species
microbiota, given think probably signature pattern
microbiota, define healthy versus unhealthy microbiota? test
this? Later talk technologies testing microbiota. lot
companies now, lot people sending stool samples mail. Never look
Postal Service way again, getting analyzed.
think this? can think things like heart rate, heart rate variability,
BMI, sorts metrics health. think microbiota?
know microbiome healthy unhealthy? - Yeah, million dollar question right
now field, lot different ways thinking that, can talk
those. say sessions conferences,
review articles commissioned. sorts thought pieces right
now, like healthy microbiota? features define it? think
diving this, important thing realize is, complex topic. Context
matters lot. healthy one person one population may not healthy
another person population. microbiota malleable. plastic, changes
human biology, think is, think health quite often, BMI
longevity, reproductive success, however want define it. certainly can
accommodate variety configurations gut microbiota, don't have...
really hard untangle different factors healthy, versus
little bit less healthy. will say no single answer this,
really important considerations. perhaps best way start talking
go back inception Human Microbiome Project, program
NIH started. invested lot money 2008, 2009 really propelling field
gut microbiome research. becoming evident point not just
curiosity human biology, probably really important health.
wonderful sequencing technology Human Genome Sequencing
Project, human genome completed point, started turning
technology sequencing gut microbes. important contextualize
amount information trying document, collective genome gut
microbes order 100 500 times larger human genome. just
terms number genes. just vast number genes,
start getting fine variation, scales 10 100 fold. really


huge amount information trying document. wonderful
investment, continues pay dividends day. one goals
project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,

appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

project try define healthy microbiome is, versus diseased microbiome
different contexts. started enrolling bunch healthy people
bunch people with, instance, inflammatory bowel disease diseases.
idea was, document microbiomes. microbes there, genes
there? can start get sense of, commonalities
healthy people, can go wrong different disease states?
answers that, studies, really started get
image tremendous individuality gut microbiome. really
hard start drawing conclusions

00:26:30 Traditional vs. Industrialized Populations

initial pass project, healthy microbiome? thing
started realize time, studies going documenting gut
microbiome traditional populations humans, hunter-gatherers, rural agricultural
populations. studies really mind-blowing perspective
people healthy, living different lifestyles, microbiome
doesn't look anything like healthy American microbiome. - mean
healthy American microbiome healthy, context living United
States consuming consumed here? superior
microbiome signature, somewhere history currently world? - Yeah, think
kind big question right now. think great quote Dobzhansky
says, "Nothing biology makes sense, except light evolution."
traditional populations modern people living planet now, lifestyle
represent closest approximation ancestors, early humans lived.
microbiomes, now know sequencing paleofeces,
microbiome traditional populations representative microbiome
evolved with, potentially shaped human genome. one possibility
industrialized world, different microbiome traditional
populations, microbiome well-adapted current lifestyle, therefore
healthy context industrialized society. probably elements
true. another possibility microbiome gone off


rails, deteriorating face antibiotic use, problems associated
industrialized diet, Western diet. even though Human Microbiome
Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

Project documented microbiome healthy people, healthy Americans,
really may documenting perturbed microbiota really
predisposing people variety

00:28:58 Resilience Microbiome

inflammatory metabolic diseases. - reminds me, neurobiologist,
weaned landscape so-called critical periods, early life environment
strongly shapes brain. many studies done animals raised
traditional cages water bottle food, maybe animals
species. people came along said, wait, normally species
wild things like things climb things go through,
provide basic elements, sudden architecture neural circuits
looks different, realize studying deprived condition. earlier
actually referred to, understood correctly, critical periods gut microbiome
development. fair say critical periods? Meaning, say my...
aim me. gut microbiome dysbiotic, off early life, can rescue
proper conditions exercise? sort fixed pattern
going hard escape from? - Yeah, big field emerging now
refer kind reprogramming gut microbiome. think want
conceptualize humans aggregate human microbial biology, people
heard CRISPR, ability potentially change human genome ways
correct genetic problems. wonderful technology, kind put table
genetic engineering cur disease, much easier change gut microbes
problem, just community malleable. issue think seeing
field microbiomes quite often, whether diseased healthy, exist
stable states. kind tend towards well gravity way, biological
gravity, really hard dislodge community state. even
individuals, instance, get antibiotics. take oral antibiotics, community
takes huge hit. know bunch microbes die, composition changes.
represents period vulnerability pathogens can come take
cause disease. doesn't happen, microbiota kind works way back


something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

something not exactly like, similar pre-antibiotic treatment. know
dietary perturbations, quite often see really rapid change gut
microbiome. almost like memory snaps back something
similar original state, even though diet remains different.
incredible, refer resilience gut microbiome, resistance
change, least resistance establishing new stable state. doesn't mean
hopeless change unhealthy microbiome healthy microbiome,
mean need think carefully restructuring communities ways
can achieve new stable state will resist microbial community getting
pulled back original state. one really simplest nicest examples
experiment performed mice, feeding mice normal
mouse diet, lot nutrients gut microbiota, things like dietary fiber.
switched mice, half mice, low fiber diet. basically asking
question switch kind Western-like diet, low fiber, higher fat diet,
happens gut microbiota? saw microbiota change, lost diversity.
similar see difference industrialized traditional
populations. brought back healthy diet, lot microbes returned,
fairly... kind memory went back similar
original state. difference put mice low fiber, high fat diet,
kept multiple generations, saw progressive
deterioration course generations whereby fourth generation, gut
microbiome fraction originally was. say 30% species
remained something like 70% species gone extinct, appeared gone
extinct. put mice back onto high fiber diet, didn't see recovery.
case, situation new stable state achieved. case,
probably mice don't actually access microbes
lost. actually know control experiment mice high fiber diet
four generations. maintain microbes. take fourth generation
mice diversity fecal transplant mice lost
microbes, returned high fiber diet, diversity
reconstituted. question like, establish new stable states?
get back healthy microbiota taken lot antibiotics,
deteriorated microbiota, probably combination access right
microbes. can talk access looks like. may look like


therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

therapeutics future. lot companies working creating cocktails
healthy microbes. it'll combination access right microbes
nourishing microbes proper diet. - interesting. multi-generational
study reminds something told early training,
takes long time trait evolve, not long time traits devolve. - Yeah,
exactly. - generally true human behavior too, although depends.

00:35:10 Regional Differences Along GI Tract

can better, nonetheless. - [Justin Sonnenburg] interesting. -
puzzle bit conundrum around notion species microbiota. pH,
acidity differs along digestive tract, less fixed given location,
right? mean, unless something's really off, pH stomach within particular
range, intestines forth. certain microbiota thrive given station,
given location along digestive tract, pH sort fixed less. trying
figure out, allowing certain microbiota stay given location? don't
migrate down? pH sensitive, selecting
along tract? also trying figure changes food robustly
change microbiome. way describe almost makes sound like food
variable going dictate quality microbiome, although sure
factors well. back mind, don't know want ask
question, really want ask question, is, exactly,
don't get flushed out? Right? - Right. - 30% fecal matter
microbiota, living? along lining, little microvilli
intestine, attaching interacting with? know
neurons there, especially within stomach, lot work now done
gut neurons signal brain forth. talking
terms host cells? - Yeah. - just food, imagine
good time, not, getting flushed not,
actually stay there? - Yeah. - attaching to?
talking about? fun? - Yeah. - forth. - Yeah, yeah. Super
interesting. come back attachment question, kind don't get
washed out, 'cause super fascinating question. think initial point
like, kind regional differences happening terms physiology,


biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

biochemistry along length gut really interesting. certainly pH
gradient along length gut. actually bicarbonate secreted
small intestine try neutralize stomach acid. also bile secreted.
creates different chemical environment there, bio-loving bacteria kind live
region gut. nutrient gradient, just food leaves
stomach, lot simple nutrients absorbed. might see microbes
small intestine, instance, better consuming simple sugars,
won't find many microbes colon like that, simple sugars
depleted point. immune system big factor well.
immune system incredibly active small intestine. small intestine really
interesting challenge host, tissue been... purpose
mainly absorptive. flow lot things, lot nutrients
luminal contents host cells. means barrier can't fortified.
immune system incredibly active small intestine make sure
microbes aren't getting close, getting close, response
put back right location. along whole kind architecture
gut, longitudinal gradients, things like pH forth. say
pH starts drop colon, lot microbes fermenting
things producing acids. actually end pH starting drop, not
low stomach, starting drop lot fermentation
happening colon. addition, also gradient host surface
epithelium middle gut. likely key retained
gut community isn't washed out. lining gut, epithelial
cells. small intestine, largely absorbative. colon, lot
mucus production. also see small intestine, mucus lining
substance secrete, largely made carbohydrate actually. purpose
keep microbes right spot allow nutrients water
absorbed small intestine large intestine. mesh work
supposed keep large things like back lead, small things like nutrients.
mucus layer is, turns slowly luminal contents passing by.
microbe learns hold onto mucus layer, can actually resist flow
contents gut. many microbes gut not just good
attaching mucus, also good nibbling it, eating it.
bacteria, like Akkermansia muciniphila, mucus-loving. One main things


actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

actually eat mucus gut, lifestyle. incredible gradient
activity host tissue, working way middle gut.
amazing microbes actually penetrate past mucus,
invaginations intestine known crypts, actually stem cells live
produce epithelium, microbial communities can form
crypts. don't know completely function is, done
studies appear indicate can localize crypt, hit jackpot
microbe able maintain dominance gut. sit crypt
something similar you, another microbe similar you, comes gut,
can actually exclude microbe. thinking can't find spot resist
washed gut. probably little niches close host tissue
mucus absolutely essential resisting getting washed

00:42:04 Fasting, Cleanses & Gut Health

flow contents. - Incredible. raises question two things
reasonably popular. One notion cleanses, either direction. People will
consume things mouth try cleanse digestive tract. long
history this. not recommending this. differing opinions whether not
good bad. fasting time-restricted feeding. reason ask
time-restricted feeding, understanding prolonged period
fasting, auto-absorption digestion one's digestive tract,
gets renewed. words, testing stomach start eating lining
extent absence food. know cleanses? Oh,
suppose cleanses direction too, right? Which, less popular,
never run statistics, certainly exist there. idea cleanses
fasting relates health dysbiosis microbiota? - Yeah,
hasn't lot high quality science area, really hard conclude
whether good health bad health. think fasting... really
interesting situation industrialized world, many problems
associated digestive tract, probably highly processed
diet perhaps microbiota fairly perturbed well. so, whether
things like good bad, really hard define, may
starting off fairly bad state anyway. many diseases dealing


with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

with, metabolic syndrome, inflammatory bowel disease, just put massive portion
population different category people thinking
maintain health, live long life, starting off consider fairly
healthy state. things like fasting lot therapies
developed field, think ketogenic diet may category well. can
tremendous benefits terms impact context metabolic syndrome,
people battling eating continual bad diet something like that. -
adherence. think one one reasons popularity intermittent fasting,
time-restricted feeding, call now? Exclusion diets,
entire entirely exclude meat, entirely exclude plants whatever is,
adherence sometimes easier none. neurobiologists, think
go, no-go circuitry. harder make decisions, nuanced decisions often, food
just eliminate entire categories food. Not eating, many people- - Yeah. -
easier eating smaller portions. - Yeah, yeah. Yeah, and- - Yeah. it,
think, neurobiological psychological. - Absolutely. gastroenterology
fellows lab come kind of... think kind slice
nuance this, simple recipe really well accepted, broad
definition healthy diet is. kind Mediterranean diet, plant-based diet is...
just ton data particularly people European ancestry,
pretty broad acceptance eat mostly plants, people, going
healthy, point where... wonderful colleague ours, Christopher Gardner,
studied diet whole life, trying establish healthy diet is. people
giving advice, saw giving advice dietician trying get rules
recommending people deals interested
healthy diet. said, number one, going say, plant-based fiber
probably super important, high list. goes
number two said, stop. said, people number one well, don't need
know rules. mean, basically like can high fiber, plant-based
diet, people, least, talking bucket people already
healthy state, don't really need think things, can't eat
much meat, can't eat many sweets. already eaten huge amount
plant-based fiber. gut full, not going hungry. kind takes care
worrying eat what, shouldn't eat. Just eat ton whole
grains, legumes, vegetables, fruit high fiber based, not high sugar. -


completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

completely exclude meat, fish dairy? - saying people can add
spins this. think main rule just start off with... kind gets
back to, Michael Pollan's mantra, eat food, not much, mostly plants. think
stick simple rules, don't overthink, like, this? Can eat
eggs? Can eat... Just kind stick simple rules, makes approachable.
agree, gastroenterology fellows lab say they...
really hard. kind say them, won't give dietary advice
really well-known. just said, well, it's, really hard get people change
diet, unless either go, no-go sort thing, eliminating something.
carrots giving problems, don't eat carrots. simple, easy
instruction follow, doesn't really deal root problem can't eat
carrots, able eat carrots. people can eat carrots.
think we... Yeah, thinking things like fasting,
different dietary regimes cleanses people do, step back
moment say, okay, well, really big, high level rules take
home? experiencing problems, want think
deal them, good go evidence-based method actually data
back up. data field really shows like fasting, particularly go
animals hibernate, things like that, really extended fasts,
actually microbiota come blooms absence food coming
diet really good eating mucus. bacteria
specialize eating nutrients derived host, no nutrients
live on. Now, whether good bad, don't know. seems like
consumption mucus excess problem standpoint microbes getting
close host tissue inciting inflammation, see animal models
deprive dietary fiber. see mucus utilizers become abundant,
inflammatory markers start come on. fasting short term might fine, probably.
definitely benefits seen metabolically. terms means long
term health standpoint gut microbiota, say don't
answer yet. terms cleanses flushes this, personally,
think terrible idea. mean, know if... studies done now
reprogram gut microbiota install completely new microbial community, first
step wash away resident microbial community there.
process acquiring really good microbiota know that, flushing


everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

everything great. Otherwise, happening kind leaving rebuilding
community chance, like it? microbes going colonize?
going take space flush cleanse? think little bit
like playing Russian Roulette. may end good microbial community
afterwards, may not. certainly want pay close attention eating
reconstitution community something like that. -
Yeah. Thank that. know lot people interested kinds
elimination diets. intermittent fasting/ time-restricted feeding seems getting
traction, part, level sleep.
us aren't eating sleep anyway, adjusting numbers seems
accessible lot people. lot colleagues Stanford know
happen regimen, time-restricted feeding regimen,

00:51:19 Dietary Differences

also follow traditional meal spacing well, course. One
things wonder talk primarily plant-based some,
say Pollan thing was? eat mostly plants maybe meat,
not much, not much... - Yeah, eat food, mostly plants, not much. - Got it. -
sorry, eat food, not much, mostly plants. - Got it. hear again.
know number people seem well lower carbohydrate,
even people report feeling much better really strictly, almost meat,
organ-only diet. reason raise not... don't participate in... one
omnivores there, eat meat eat plants well.
reason raise earlier talking communities may
microbiota healthier ours, least different ours.
communities world subsist largely animal products,
unprocessed animal products considered richest-nutrient foods
communities. Protein scarce in... Ancestrally, protein scarce, eggs
meat things sort. genetic component?
words, fast forward 10 years actually can make sense human
genome stuff, going find someone Scandinavian roots,
somebody South American roots, somebody descended different
tribe, will better one particular diet versus another, thereby, say,


parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip

derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,

evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling

therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream

seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way

shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

parallel that, gut microbiome will different signatures are...
microbiome might thrive plants mine might thrive organ meats.
say this, not big consumer organ meats. just laying sake
example. - Yeah. Yeah, great. So, notes, first one
carbohydrates restriction carbohydrates, people feeling healthier
cut carbohydrates out. guess is... theory tested, people feel
better cutting carbohydrates out, diet eat United States
industrialized countries, carbohydrates largely crap. - Processed. -
processed. - Right. - like starch, simple sugar. things contribute glycemic
index. sugars eat. make small intestine, get
chopped simple sugars, absorbed bloodstream, ton
glucose coursing veins, know bad can lead things
like diabetes. carbohydrates diet complex carbohydrates,
dietary fiber, like refer subset dietary fiber microbiota can
actually access microbiota-accessible carbohydrates. reason like
term word carbohydrate it. point not carbs bad,
just, bad carbs carbs, carbs bad consume
high quantity, things like table sugar simple starches, good carbs
well. microbiota-accessible carbohydrates complex ones can't
digest, fuel got microbiota, gut microbiota can ferment them. think
probably better off less carbs typically served,
us, probably vast majority us better off consuming lot
carbs complex, microbiotic-accessible. come back
important terms biology. mechanisms known
complex carbohydrates important health, us.
think aspect human genetic adaptation diet super interesting. layer
top got microbiota adaptation diet, another layer also
fascinating. clear short periods time, humans can adapt
differences diet, lactase persistence kind classic example this. Just
past 10,000 years, certain groups humans adapted able
consume dairy taking enzyme, lactase, normally just expressed
world's population early life able metabolize lactose breast milk.
extending expression throughout life, now can consume milk
whole life. example specific populations human genome,


genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

genetically adapting diet short period time. examples
this, undoubtedly, happened throughout world various aspects
diets. certainly important remember will different diets
better different groups, based genes harbor human
genome. aspect top that, good examples gut
microbiome adapting cultural differences diet. classic example
degradation seaweed. know Americans, eat sushi,
nori eat seaweed, dietary fiber known
porphyrin. porphyrin will shoot us untransformed. Inert substance.
It'll things like retain water, serve kind something like cellulose, not
fermented high level. somebody Southeast Asia always consumed
seaweed, part culture consumes seaweed, eats seaweed,
gut microbe can now metabolize porphyrin. specific
gene transfer events genes breaking porphyrin imported
microbiome many people Southeast Asia to... can think helping
digest porphyrin, really just microbe found niche, found way make
living gut consuming something common diet there.
different layers, human genetic adaptations, microbiome
adaptations cultural, based people's geographic location. no
escaping fact much human evolution, vast majority people
planet ancestors hunter-gatherers, foraging, consuming huge
quantities plant material, just there. one groups
study, Hadza hunter-gatherers Africa, take moment just
say research, research many people field fields rely
study indigenous communities. really important think communities,
equals, modern people planet. interesting lifestyles
informative regard certain aspects human biology, many cases,
also leading vulnerable existence. really take great care research
program, important people realize populations take part
research, wonderful research partners. need mindful
kind thinking how, yeah, talk use data
gained generous contribution research program. Hadza
hunter-gatherers, estimated, consume order 100 150 grams dietary fiber
per day, stark contrast typical American consumes 15


grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

grams. somewhere, seven tenfold decrease main nutrient feeds
got microbiome American diet. Hadza one example. many
different foraging populations, vast majority populations consume huge
amounts dietary fiber, plants reliable, consistent source. you,
hunter-gatherer go hunt, usually hunt unsuccessful. think data one
20 hunts successful landing actually big game Hadza.
birds shoot small animals, quite often, day day, relying
upon berries, tubers, baobab fruit. relying plants environment.
actually go data look fruit food preferences are, food
preferences actually meat honey. don't eat high fiber diet
love fiber. eat high fiber diet, available consistent
survive. brains wired caloric density. took
Hadza put restaurant United States, make
crappy decisions make, want sugar fat calories.
brain wired. - protein fat brain development, far know, right?
sounds like Hadza, hope pronouncing correctly, said prefer
eat meat honey, happen consume lot plant fiber

01:01:24 Simple vs. Complex Carbohydrates, Processed Foods

consequence available. One questions relates
this, sounds like no question pure vegan way
extreme opposite, pure meat diet, avoiding processed foods
good idea. - Yeah. - heavily processed foods, general mean, not
occasional consumption necessarily bad. whether not one thinking one
macronutrient profile another, sounds like consuming processed foods just bad
microbiome. Can say categorically? sure, yeah, yeah. - Okay. -
Absolutely. - low carb person, zero carb person, extreme
vegan, no meat. Whether not meat, organ meat. Sounds
number one thing, maybe even, dare say Chris's point plants, although
not going challenge Chris Gardner nutrition, way outside lane lines
that. avoiding processed foods? - Yeah. - paramount. - Yeah,
think completely compatible Christopher saying. saying,
prioritize getting huge amount whole, plant-based food lot fiber first,


not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

not going room eating lot processed food. - [Andrew Huberman]
Yeah, yeah. - kind avoiding processed food. think
exactly rule, think exactly right. can break down...
lot data different components processed food bad us,
bad microbiome. can talk examples that. flip
side mechanism of... again, thinking spectrum plant-
based diet versus meat-based diet. lot data tell us meat
ketogenic, high fat diet may big benefits terms short term metabolic health.
typically people think diet. also lot heart disease
linked well. good literature that, something people
look aware of. plant-based diet, eating bunch complex fibers
feed gut microbiota, gut microbiota produces substances called
short-chain fatty acids, things like butyrate. known short-chain fatty
acids play really essential components, terms fueling colonocytes, enforcing
barrier, keeping inflammation low, regulating immune system, regulating
metabolism. lot people think dietary fiber inert substance
passes through, makes feel full maybe little bit, get hungry afterwards
right away. eating lot fiber feeding gut microbiota, gut
microbiota just producing vast array fermentation end products get
absorbed bloodstream, tremendous, cascading effects
appear largely beneficial biology. think paradigm
simple carbs, versus complex carbs, case simple carbs, end high
blood sugar, something will spike insulin, kinds weird, metabolic
effects. case complex carbohydrates, end low blood sugar,
low glycemic index bunch short-chain fatty acids
regulatory roles. just round topic, think reason
think that, maybe not appropriate absolutely everyone there, think vast
majority people, particularly given statistics know people eat
United States industrialized countries, people reap tremendous health
benefits eating whole, plant-based dietary fiber. Now, processed foods,
think, dimension weird chemicals, artificial
sweeteners, weird fats, lot refined, simple nutrients. simple nutrients
talked about, know instance, artificial sweeteners can massive
negative impact gut microbiome can lead us towards metabolic syndrome,


actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

actually. beautiful work Weizmann Institute this.
emulsifiers, compounds put processed foods help maintain
shelf stability things don't separate. moisture content retained
appropriately. Many known disrupt mucus layer, soon
start disrupting barrier, can lead direction inflammation
animal models, know can lead towards metabolic syndrome well.
components processed food, are, studied isolation known
direct negative impact gut biology microbiota. - Yeah, mention artificial
sweeteners interesting. confess third rail on... Talking artificial sweeteners,
two camps seems, least two camps. One say artificial sweeteners
not detrimental all. Another says detrimental, mainly based
mouse studies. people middle are... put
category. drink occasional diet soda, don't consume large volume,
sort middle there. just throw there, know
immediately people jumping that, will just mention recent data
Diego Bohorquez's lab Duke University neurons live gut
mucose neuro pod cells can actually distinguish artificial true
sweet... Sugar versus artificial sweeteners. send different patterns neural signals
brain, brain circuitry seems strongly impacted. think
data emerge,

01:07:03 Artificial & Plant-based Sweeteners

hearing artificial sweeteners. Either problematic
least signaling different events gut. want make sure distinguish
artificial sweeteners non-caloric plant-based sweeteners. - Yeah. -
based mistake made podcast just
kind lump artificial sweeten one big category, mention stevia.
plant-based sweeteners not artificial, weren't manufactured
laboratory, like saccharin sucralose, aspartame? know anything plant-
based, non caloric sweeteners low caloric sweeteners? - little. lot
lot bang buck. incredibly sweet, takes really small
amount trigger huge amount sweetness. it's, depending upon
mechanism action sweeteners not sugar impacting


biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

biology. may actually less negative healthy ones
artificial, just requires less food us perceive
sweet taste. may also they're... don't think everything
natural better, necessarily things artificial, may
kind evolutionary exposure compounds diet, historically are,
think, traditional populations use these, instance, sweeten different foods,
bodies just know deal compounds better ones
synthetic. think studies still need done. - actively avoid artificial
sweeteners? Sucralose, aspartame, saccharin? personally. - Yeah. do, avoid
them, not... work closely wife, Erica, know.
lab together wrote book, "The Good Gut," kind document
journey changing lifestyle, dietary habits, choices make based research
gotten know gut microbiota past 15 years. think
one lessons learned just things moderation makes
lot easier, things slowly makes lot easier. rules
hard fast. pretty flexible eater. don't believe diet
Coke will somehow cascade terrible disease something like that. try
avoid them, don't really like flavor them. super sensitive nuances
flavor, even stevia mogrosides monk fruit stuff like that. off
flavors really hard deal with. also journey changing diet...
Like started off microbiome research, habit afternoons
sweet, muffin cookie, something like that. started
realize eating less sweets eating dietary fiber,
incredibly difficult change make. just wired kind crave this- - Classic
scientist. Scientists love pastry afternoon coffee. - Yeah, yeah. -
old days used cigarette too. - Right, exactly. - started training,
lot people still smoked - Yeah, right. - post-doctoral
training eliminate smoking campuses, productivity took trough
while, people developed tools focus attention. - Exactly, exactly.
kind need, ingrained behavior, maybe
things addictive, becomes incredibly difficult break habit.
say, gradually course like, five years, migrated diet
away sweet foods things less sweet. journey,
slow process, gotten point now just retrained pallets.


amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

amazing happens now, something something
would've used like daily. unpalatable. just can't deal
sweetness it. certainly avoid artificial sweeteners, also avoid just sweet
things general sugar them, just now, originally,
trying disciplined trying change diet, now just don't taste good
me. - Yeah, likewise, completely lost appetite sugar turn last year,
don't know explain it, way I... Even though don't
mechanistic explanation, say like sweet people, don't like sweet food anymore. just
don't. not lost appetite fatty foods. love cheese certain meats me,
blame Argentine lineage is, gravitate towards them. case, avoiding
processed foods, probably avoiding sugars, emulsifiers, kinds things.
people listening watching, not setting strict guidelines. just bouncing
around carnival microbiome nutrition, think hear
everywhere, eat this, don't eat that, best microbiome, worse
microbiome. hearing fiber again, going come back fiber,
want make sure close hatch issue fasting cleansing.

01:12:44 Cleanses: Useful? Harmful?

Based answer earlier, sounds like not necessary cleanse
fast prior attempt repopulate microbiome. words, want make
microbiome healthier, sounds like don't try flush current
microbiota first, correct? - Yeah, good question, don't
mean suggest things known terrible. just say,
studies haven't done. me, wiping microbial community, unless
done sort of... Unless done informed way, don't really
information done. just seems like playing lottery little
bit. - Okay. - think... don't want say are... may
study done, shown amazing, just don't think data
know yet. somewhat arbitrary thing. somebody feels way
better this, not experiencing problems it, maybe
right thing them. certainly can't say something great do. can't
imagine future microbiome gets incorporated emerging paradigm
precision health, go clinic, somebody types microbiome says, oh,


huge, massive misconfiguration. engrafted bacteria
residents gut microbiome sending molecules not good
health. good mass-reprogramming it. way
flush gut, actually give light antibiotic treatment try kill
everything there. repopulate consortium microbes
studied know healthy, know compatible human genome,
can reinforced diet know good you. install
microbes, help along diet know nourish microbes,
will way will reconfigure gut microbiome. can't imagine
future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

future sort flushing,

01:14:50 Microbiome & Immune System

cleansing part something repopulating gut. right now seems little
half-baked me. Yeah. - Great. love talk fiber fermented foods,
Chris really, think really interesting exciting paper
end last year comparing inflammatome, inflammatory markers
people ate certain amount fiber, certain amount fermented foods.
study amazing several reasons, almost amazing diverse
interpretation study media. ever study kind
hijacked different priority schemes there- - Yeah. - study.
performed study Chris, postdocs, graduate students staff.
major conclusions sorts directives, any, emerged
study? just preface saying, wasn't clear, news report said,
"Ah, means fiber not important." - Yeah. - others said, means
fermented foods fiber important. others said, fermented foods thing,
thing. place. - Yep. - one reasons
podcast can go straight people perform work. -
Fantastic. - even though certainly not expert microbiome, give
opportunity share me, ask kinds questions have...
zero agenda. like sauerkraut, drink occasional kombucha. like low
sugar, not sweet forms fermented foods. delighted fermented
foods good me, no stake fermented food industry. - Yeah,
absolutely. - Yeah. - Yeah, yeah. Great. Yeah, wonderful, important note


one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like

microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,

array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum

evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot

bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites

shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

one pointed out, incredible collaboration Christopher
Gardner's lab, bunch people. Erica Sonnenburg helped lead study,
tons of, like saying, postdoc staff people Stanford,
wonderful participants part study. huge team effort. Let tell you,
dive study, let take step back, think reason
study, kind Christopher's group, group started pursue
line looking dietary interventions impact microbiome,
impact human biology, goes back kind epiphany studying
gut microbiome. think started studying Stanford,
thinking kind newly appreciated aspect biology, almost like
finding organ didn't know there, starting think like
drug targets there. Can go small molecule drugs, think ways
manipulate community ameliorate disease? largely mindset
Western medicine, largely born era infectious disease. wait
infection start bacterial infection, treat antibiotics, way
medicine practiced, become less successful time, moved
era inflammatory, Western diseases, exception current
pandemic sweeping world, largely moved era infectious diseases,
least infectious bacterial diseases, paradigm waiting diseases
appear, come clinic not really effective context inflammatory,
Western diseases, autoimmune diseases, metabolic syndrome, heart diseases,
inflammatory disease. list goes on. started think lot
like, can get front this? can think preventative ways
dealing crisis metabolic inflammatory diseases? tremendous,
beautiful body literature started come forward field 10 years ago
showed gut microbiome absolutely critical modulating immune status.
change microbiome, can fundamentally change immune
system operates. know immune system basis lot
disease, inflammatory, chronic diseases. brought possibility maybe
fact not nourishing community well enough, maybe fact
deteriorated time due things go along industrialized
lifestyle, antibiotics forth. Maybe microbiome right now
industrialized world setting immune system set point, simmering
inflammation driving us towards inflammatory diseases. wouldn't


wonderful figure use diet specifically, just kind learn
rules reconfigure composition function gut microbiome,
inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,

microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring

Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,

array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling

therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream

seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive

know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

inflammation different bodies, one us less likely go
develop inflammatory disease, leading better longevity health
course life.

01:20:17 Dietary Fiber & Fermented Foods

studying actually mouse models, realizing really
needed start human studies. needed start studying microbiome
humans, studying diet, knew something
go right away. didn't apply FDA approval drug
human study, just start human dietary interventions,
longitudinally monitoring immune system, microbiome, starting put
pieces together diet can change microbiome healthy way,
help us define healthy microbiome is, monitor immune system great
detail. really two critical components this, addition
microbiome expertise. One Christopher Gardner's group. wanted
human studies, absolutely terrified humans. work mice. Humans
terrifying many ways. - house themselves, don't pay- -
true. - don't pay housing. - true. - can afford
housing, course, yeah. - Yeah, sadly, just portion population.
Christopher's group were, masters working human populations.
wonderful thing Stanford Human Immune
Monitoring Center run Mark Davis Holden Maecker. started beautiful
center allowing people immunology humans. Critical element, lot
mouse studies don't translate well humans. can studies
humans, similar thinking microbiome, learn something
know relevant humans. immune profiling capability
can monitor hundreds thousands different parameters immune
system, longitudinally people, blood draw, not just know CRP goes
interleukin-6 goes down, able see facets immune
system change concert, changing microbiome diet really key
component this. flagship study, supported wonderful donors.


actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.

organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

actually isn't funded typical foundations national institutes health, funded
philanthropy. wanted understand put people high fiber diet,
affect microbiome immune system? put high food
diet, diet rich live microbes metabolites present
fermentation foods, change microbiome immune system? -
give us examples diets look like? changing
basal diet, just adding things top already eating?
'Cause hard change people's diets. - hard. - trust
actually not sneaking, and- - Totally, yeah. started
center human microbiome studies Stanford lot studies,
portion studies, focus supplements, probiotics, microbes delivered pill
form. Prebiotics, purified forms fiber. cases, actually can
placebo groups, like drug study, don't change people's
diets. can just administer top doing. way,
lot controlled, not food. start food studies, can't
placebo group, 'cause people know eating. problem
really hard just change one thing, soon start adding something,
people usually eliminate something else. idea basically give people
simple instructions case high fiber diet, just increasing plant-based fiber.
can eat whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts, get fiber
range of, 15 20 grams per day, 40 grams per day. can
double amount fiber eat per day, knowing
tremendous impact lot facets diet. eat less meat,
animal-based protein, less animal-based fats product this. will say getting
back Christopher's rule healthy diet, lot macro nutrient changes
saw diet consistent healthy changes diet. Less saturated fat, less
animal-based protein, plant-based protein. lot changes known
beneficial came concert just telling people, eat high fiber diet, high plant-
based fiber diet. people eating high fermented food diet,
instructed basically eat foods buy grocery store naturally
fermented contain live microbes. largely consisted yogurt, kefir,
sauerkraut, kimchi, fermented vegetables, brined, fermented vegetables. - Pickles.
- Pickles, things like that. One things think pitfall choosing fermented
foods is, can go canned food aisle huge section pickles,


jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch

cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

jars canned. not fermented foods. cucumbers
put acidic acid vinegar reconstitute fermented flavor,
no live microbes involved that. even sauerkrauts canned food aisle, even
naturally fermented, quite often not. Quite often just brined
vinegar. even naturally fermented, microbes killed prior
canning process canning. use study want
live fermented foods contain live microbes, need buy
refrigerated section, essentially. - really glad pointed out,
can find sauerkraut non-refrigerated shelf, indeed non fermented. lot
fermented available US can high sugar. instruction
getting people make sure consuming yogurts weren't loaded
sugar? - Yep. - let just select stuff cold section
fermented? - No, super important point. instructed people eat non-sweetened
yogurts. think huge pitfall area can yogurt loaded bacteria,
kind base healthy, ton like artificial flavoring sugar
loaded top that. Manufacturers put ton sugar fact kind mask
sour taste fermented foods, hard people become accustomed
to. switching fermented foods, daughters young
point, take plain yogurt, didn't like just neat, mix little
maple syrup honey, just little bit, gradually reduced time
point pallet adjusted, now just really like plain yogurt. is,
think, getting used sour flavor difficult, people really try stay
away fermented foods loaded sugar.
instructed people study. - beer not included. - Right. - number
people asked, brief thing social media study,
hopefully got right. think did. people just ask beer. not drinker,
me, beer no appeal anyway. beer fermented, correct?
instructed avoid beer drink beer? - Just go normal dietary habits,
not count fermented food. - kombucha was, recall- - Kombucha
was, kombucha can small amounts alcohol it. Yeah, kombucha actually
one major things people drank during, consumed fermented
food phase. deal beer may beneficial properties
microbial communities naturally fermented beer, beer buy,
again, canned filtered, no live microbes there. different


siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms

Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care

siphon off home brew drink it, probably, buy store. -
will get results study just one moment. want say, lot people
shy away high quality fermented foods, can quite costly.
just refer people resource Tim Ferriss's book, "The 4-Hour Chef," actually
gives excellent recipe making sauerkraut, basically involves
cabbage water salt, properly, can grow
some, not necessarily lethal, somewhat dangerous bacteria don't scrape
off top layer properly, gives beautiful instructions vats.
started home now, actually, got a, just ceramic vat.
can make large amounts truly fermented sauerkraut just cabbage water salt,
willing follow protocol. interested science, protocol
looks lot like graduate career, except maybe
sequencing too. anyway, just refer people source low cost. - Yeah.
- Compared buying high quality, fermented foods. Even kombuchas,
people, like $5 bottle- - Totally. - much. consume liquids
way consume them, just start, so- - Yeah. can get hands
SCOBY, kombucha another one super simple. - can grow own. -
can just make own, super easy do. make it, constantly
batch kombucha going home. SCOBY, symbiotic community bacteria
yeast. brew tea, add sugar it, put SCOBY in, wait
week two, depending upon temperature, just move SCOBY
new batch, old, SCOBY kombucha,
wonderful. - love it, love members audience start make
kombucha sauerkraut. much fun. don't it, done
home. don't go anywhere near food production, everyone's
benefit. much fermented food consuming? 'Cause mentioned
number grams approximately fiber, servings, ounces? many times
day? Early day, late day? - Right, yeah. wonderful dietician instructing
people this, name's Dalia Perelman, really key
key many studies getting people eat differently. general
instructions people eat much fermented foods possible, better.
reason initial study, really wanted maximize chance
seeing signal something biological going on, idea dose
excessive not easily achievable lot people end, can go back


say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back

places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment

say, okay, point lose biological signal. people
height intervention phase, intervention phase six weeks,
height that, six servings, average, per day fermented foods.
kind two servings meal. ounces weight size, really depended
fermented food was. just told stick
recommended dose package buying, kombucha, it'd like
six eight ounce glass. Sauerkraut like half cup, something like that,

01:32:13 High-Fiber vs. High-Fermented Diet; Inflammation

yogurt. - Great. results? - Yeah, results
astounded us way, thinking deeply, it'll evident even
explain context conversation, likely saw results saw.
results astounding hypothesis going high fiber
diet going give massive signal. know big deficiency
Western diet. mouse studies told us high fiber really leads much
healthier microbiota, can lead positive changes immune system. fact,
even limited... wonderful donor support, still limited amount
money started study. lab really eager high fiber
part really well, Christopher kind twist arms fermented
food side it. thought kind quirky neat, live microbes
exciting, try it. put turns thankful
twisted arms, high fermented food arm really gave us
big signal. Even though hypothesis high fiber going lead
short-chain fatty acids produced gut, diverse microbiota, less inflammation
immune system, didn't see across cohort. actually saw
individualized responses dietary fiber, come back responses
were. big signal really fermented food group. saw things
hope see Western microbiota western human. saw increase
microbiota diversity course six weeks consuming
fermented foods. can't always say higher diversity better comes
microbial communities. know cases instance, bacterial vaginosis,
higher diversity actually indicative disease state, know
context gut, people living industrialized world, higher diversity


generally better. know spectrum diversity. People higher
diversity generally healthier. can push diversity higher, better
shape. saw increase diversity. major question is,
happened immune system people increasing gut microbiota
diversity fermented foods? massive immune profiling,
see couple dozen immune markers, inflammatory markers decrease course
study. measured multiple time points throughout course
study, kind set stepwise reduction things like interleukin-6,
interleukin-12, variety famous inflammatory mediators. even go
immune cells start looking signaling cascades, see
signaling cascades less activated end study compared beginning
study, indicating attenuation inflammation. kind exactly
hypothesize lead less propensity inflammatory disease time.
huge extension short study and- - long study again? -
complete protocol think 14 17 weeks, something like that. actual
intervention phase consisted four week ramp six week maintenance
period. intervention 10 weeks, six weeks really kind
hardcore, high levels fiber fermented foods. - Yeah, glad mentioned
ramp, 'cause experience fermented foods you, can beneficial give
system opportunity act acclimate. mean, consume giant bowl
sauerkraut, not going worst day night life, know
did. - Totally. - just leave that. want kind acclimate it. -
Absolutely. - point now where, people might think gross,
exercise, sweating lot, like saltiness the... actually drink liquid
sauerkraut stewing in, get, like think consume
fermentation way, salty, kind post-training replenishment.
done six months ago, straight off, think would've pretty rough
system. started taking little bits adding day. - Totally,
fermented foods fiber, well known kind gradual ramping
really important way mitigating bloating, digestive discomfort can
happen microbiome reconfigures starts fermenting more, changing
community members. take ramp pace. something
seems going wrong, just kind level off, stay there. delicate
way get people high dose. brine, just tangent second,


actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch

go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring

Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste

addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid

immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules

array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip

derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum

evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

actually one products people use fermented food phase.
actually product called Gut Shots, just bring marketed.
actually now studying lab. just actually, came lab
meeting GI fellow lab actually putting Gut Shots, sterilized gut microbe,
fermentation microbes removed present mice looking changes
mucosal immune system. studying detail now, rich
source lactate bunch interesting metabolites. - love weird
behavior inadvertently studied Stanford Medicine. want just mention
something Gut Shots. sold drink. also, just certain
listeners different budgets, can expensive really think about...
exceedingly expensive. described making
kombuchas, not quite brining, homemade sour sauerkraut, protocol
there, mentioned Tim's book, "The 4-Hour Chef." get lot
brining that, almost endless amount. cautionary note, went
refrigerator saw something similar Gut Shot, wasn't Gut Shot. drank
whole 12 ounce bottle, realized 24 servings. got
initial experience not ramp phase. - Yeah. not recommend
that. these, potent, seems, can consume even half
ounce ounce. - Yeah, mean, potent standpoint fermentation,
also salty. lot effects can.... Yeah. - Yeah, don't
do, - Yeah. - least not outset. experienced warning.
this, recall, swap condition halt condition.
controls, right? wasn't just comparing groups. individuals initially
one group moved different group, correct? stop return.
- Yeah, actually just stop followed washout phase.
ideal situation dietary interventions like crossover studies,
suggesting. recently completed ketogenic versus Mediterranean diet
intervention- - data published yet? - Not yet, Christopher's Tweeting
lot data paper revision right now. go Christopher
Gardner's Twitter feed, able find reporting early results
study. - Can give us snippet of, superior... Just give us a,
don't tell us one, superior condition either
Mediterranean versus ketogenic? - metabolic effects these, beautiful
study. let group comment that. microbiota data actually just


generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now

little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

generating now. study group put together largely
independent microbiota data. - Right. - now depth
analysis, say future. - return that, yeah. -
super exciting study, one people eat certain way.
really beautiful even got food delivered part
intervention. complete control least available eat.
second phase, make food own. cross
thing. really like, good enough budget,
right way study like this. this, didn't time money
crossover, washout phase people, didn't make stop
eating, whatever, enjoying it, monitored.
recidivism decrease fiber fermented food. see,
instance, diversity start plateau reverse many people.
appear need maintenance intervention maintain perceived health
benefits measuring. - Great. will provide link study
caption, thank clear thorough description, one
investigators involved study.

01:41:33 Ripple Effects Healthy Diet

great go direct source. Anecdotally, movements mood,
resistance colds infection course study? kind
prelude headed next, tremendous amount interest
so-called gut-brain axis. also want make sure talk
microbes conditions establishing gut creating positive
negative health effects. mean, basically signals get gut. - Totally. Yeah. -
certainly notice eating fermented foods, probiotics
drinks consume forth, feel quote, unquote, air quotes, completely
subjective, feel better. - Yeah. - wish objective measure feeling better.
seem think clearly, sleep better, mood, et cetera, know not alone
that. time taken harsh antibiotics, feel worse, again, usually
taking feeling bad something else, right? don't take just
because. people say feeling better way? so,
observe? again, highlighting anecdata. - Yeah, totally. We,


part effort look dietary interventions affect health wellbeing,
forth, microbiome immune system, interact lot people read
book, kind become microbiome enthusiasts. implemented lot
changes personal life. hear thing saying,
Andrew, tons people say energy. think clearly,
sleep better, family nicer other, like number crazy things.
really hard uncouple, like, people taken charge now
eating just feel better general control
doing, cascading set effects actually impacting our... Kind
emanating gut-brain axis. actually implemented bunch
questionnaires even cognitive test try get this. say,
list goes on. people claim complexion
improves, allergies... probably sorts ripple effects.
can affect inflammation, know can affect cognition, know
can affect skin inflammation occurring skin. really think
basis lot anecdotes. may just hard see short
study small cohort people short period time, didn't really see
significant things associated cognition moods things
testing which, yeah, variety explanations that. also
standardized stool measure people use, less constipation, better
bowel movements course interventions. seem like
bowel habits improved, lot times can lead better moods, weren't
able measure. - classic psychoanalyst field day that.
sorts interesting things observe

01:45:00 High-Fiber Diet Make Inflammation Worse?

fiber group? clear group yielded unexpected findings
directions. Things expected see, didn't see amplitude
fermented food group, guessing also saw
interesting things fiber group. - Totally, yeah. started looking data
detail didn't see cohort-wide response. one things
observed measuring immune parameters, appeared three
different groups immune responses seeing. One group got overall


less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind
working dirt whatever, maybe not important wash hands
lunch, even little bit dirt them. public
playground maybe kids germs, maybe even chemicals like
pesticides herbicides used, maybe important wash
hands. Certainly grocery store subway, probably
good idea wash hands. think really need think kind
context it. Exposure microbes environment likely important part
educating immune system, keeping proper balance immune system.
just matter figuring right way safely. may
fermented food result saw way tapping pathways,

01:50:15 Gut Microbiome’s Effect Physiology

kind environmental exposure microbes safe. - Interesting. like touch
signals get gut rest body. probably don't time
go systems benefit diverse microbiome healthy
microbiome. talked immune system. active signaling
transport gut, along length, far know, bloodstream,
organs tissues. immune system, seems straightforward.
reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe
increase anti-inflammatory cytokines, like IL-10 others. know
gut-brain access neurons literally talk directions brain gut.
say eating fermented foods, right things, gut
diverse goodies right places. fact


microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system
sending signals back brain, dictating things like motility. get rid
here? move along quickly? actually happening? need interact
immune cells? really complex array interactions different
cell types. lot cells gut, perceiving signals,
lot immune cells can actually get leave. can get blood, cycle
through, home regions mucosal surfaces, mucosal
surfaces educated broadly passing gut.
variety ways cells communicating, lot molecules
microbiota makes can actually make way bloodstream directly.
array molecules still defined, trying figure
chemicals are. mentioned short-chain fatty acids, just tip
iceberg. really interesting compounds like indole derivatives phenols,
derived amino acids, metabolized gut microbes, taken bloodstream.
metabolize these, become kind co-microbe host metabolites,
can go bind different receptors throughout body, anywhere
bloodstream access to,

01:56:45 Gut-Brain Connection

start trigger signaling cascades. - known whether not
molecules small enough cross blood-brain barrier? hypothesis
current thinking neurotransmitters manufactured gut, signaling
along gut-brain axis, literally neurons talking back forth electrically brain
gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum
disorders, maybe even ADHD. basically saying


evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really

really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad

broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make

story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk

Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife

less inflammatory, two groups kind mixed result, partly
inflammatory, partly less inflammatory markers looking at.
started digging like, aspect biology people dictated
predicted group fell into, really interesting part people highest
diversity gut microbiomes start study ones likely
decreases inflammation. data seemed telling us start off
diverse microbiota, maybe one better equipped degrade wide variety
dietary fiber, likely respond positively it. depleted gut
microbiome, not likely able respond it. thinking back
experiment talked multi-generational loss fiber-
fermenting microbes mice fed Western diet, may many us
industrialized world microbiome depleted now, even
consume high fiber diet, least short period time, don't right
microbes gut degrade fiber. actually observed
groups, beautiful study University Minnesota, looking immigrants, coming
United States. within nine months, certainly course years,
immigrants come lose lot diversity gut microbiome, lot
fiber-degrading capacity gut microbiome too. time,
becomes one way street, hard us recover microbes actually can
degrade fiber.

01:47:22 Sterilized Environments

think probably intersects sanitation environment, fact
don't access new microbes might help us degrade fiber.
actually lost microbes, ways irrecoverable without
deliberate reintroduction fiber-degrading microbes. - can recall childhood,
kids eat dirt. - Yeah. - snails stuff. just sounds totally
disgusting, bu kids covered mud maybe not much anymore. certainly
pandemic, lot use hand sanitizers, prior that,
people seemed pretty spooked about, obviously prioritized them. Well,
children. encourage to... young, encourage
interact pets dirt and- - Absolutely, yeah. - Stuff environment,
provided stuff wasn't immediately toxic? - Exactly. really... continual


cost-benefit analysis, think. will say pandemic now, certainly just
infectious diseases general, really important aware possibility
compromising health spread germs. just, hand
washing important, careful spread germs. think
sanitization environment gone overboard various things
impregnated antibiotics, shopping carts things like that, toothbrushes.
like antibiotics things killing microbes everywhere.
raising... daughters young making decisions,
calculations make really one, likely encounter
disease-causing microbe? hike garden, just kind

reduce amount number inflammatory cytokines, like IL-6 forth, maybe

microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,

ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,

gut gut brain regulates things like mood, least animal models.
emerging human studies, improvement symptoms autism spectrum

evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
measure inflammatome? - Exactly, blood draws- - [Andrew Huberman]
Blood draws don't lie, good. - Yep, yep, right. - covered
tremendous amount information, incredibly grateful. area
biology, despite learned lot papers going talks
reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find
work doing? can certainly provide links, wife


co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make
accessible people not microbiome scientists. also really interesting
story. conference site just scientific conferences summer long,
week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,
microbiome conference, people work dining comments came
us said, "What group this? weird." like, "What's weird?"
said, "We can't keep salad bar stocked." clear nobody
go microbiome conference everybody
stuff doing. anyway, wrote book talk
personal journey science field, yeah, just lay foundation
people want start thinking changes. terms
connecting research, certainly Center Human Microbiome Studies
Stanford, kind home base lot dietary
interventions. list studies there, give information doing.
lab website people can go read research.
Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife
Chris do, continuing do. think area that, started training,
heard little bit microbiota, always just thought people work
infectious disease bad stuff. interesting and, really important
people realize carrying vital cargo need take care
cargo can take care us. thank much time

microbiota thriving conveyed rest body?
thing, don't know mind, probably not
thinking taking care me, Andrew. feel better, might get sick less often,
combat illness quickly. actually happening?
microbiomes stay restricted gut, signaling molecules downstream,
downstream way, making good bad things happen? sort
direct recognition body level, cells body responding to,
ah, gut microbiome healthy, therefore can make good stuff,
less bad stuff, speak. - Yeah, great. right, super complex.
huge array ways body perceives microbes molecules
produce gut, molecules produce are, course, product
microbes there, receive kind metabolic inputs,
eating microbes present environment, providing
molecules them. So, complex matrix, we... Probably simplest place
start just immune system. immune system that, vast majority
immune cells body located gut, just dense
population microbes have... consider beneficial microbes,
beneficial right spot gut. soon mislocalize,
know can become opportunistic pathogens. immune system
really playing important role keep place essential system not
moving disease space. immune system variety ways monitoring
microbes there. actually specialized structures gut known
peyer's patches actually take microbes. actually allow microbes transit
population immune cells controlled way, set immune
cells becomes educated microbes just side barrier. -
Wow, kind like border patrol. - Exactly, yeah. bring in, fingerprint
them, kind set responses ready go needed. - [Andrew
Huberman] Amazing. - cells known dendritic cells, special type types
actually send long arms, processes lumen gut,
thing, take microbes, bring back sample them. addition
direct sampling mechanisms, cells line gut huge array receptors,
specialized proteins, perceive patterns, molecular patterns microbes make.
things like endotoxin lipopolysaccharide, just cell wall bacteria.
specialized receptors recognize those. signals become profound,


perceived wrong place, can stimulate inflammatory response.
ways monitoring membership, close is.
whole set ways perceiving metabolic activity,
happening gut. mentioned before, cell types, express taste
receptors gut ways sampling dietary components.
types of, analogous cells gut perceiving metabolites produced
microbiota bodies can perceive sort metabolic activity going on.
addition that, tremendously important nervous system

reading articles media remained somewhat mysterious today.
given us vivid picture system works. can people find

co-run lab, book topic. tell us book,
can learn Sonnennburg Lab work doing?
Maybe people will even try enroll studies. - Yeah, fantastic, yeah.
It'd great get people enroll. always looking willing participants.
Yeah, Erica, wife wrote book called "The Good Gut," really
response changing lives response field,
familiar research. Seeing lot friends weren't studying got
microbiome, well informed, many scientists, not
things doing. clear just lack information
funneling field people. wanted make

week week, week, different fields. people work
just dealing new groups coming week week week,

Yeah, always looking participants studies. - Great, well, will
provide links sources. just want say, thank much
sharing us knowledge incredible work Erica, wife

evidence emerging improving gut microbiome can improve outcomes
psychiatric developmental disorders. telling
microbiota manufacturing chemicals can make bloodstream.
therefore asking chemicals can move bloodstream
brain directly. may not gut-brain axis via neurons. actually just
seepage serotonin brain, acetylcholine brain matter. -
Totally, yeah. biology molecules not well understood,
certainly like cerebral spinal fluid analyzed, can perceive
microbial metabolites, there. - answer, yeah.
getting across barrier. - really interesting thing is, think lot
molecules are, experienced high enough doses, toxic toxic
properties. know lot metabolites, make way
bloodstream, eventually excreted kidneys urine. actually can
monitor metabolism going gut actually looking metabolites
present urine, many originated gut,
gut microbes. people kidney disease, whose kidneys' filtering processes not
functioning properly, actually build high levels many metabolites
bloodstream, can lead molecules making across blood-
brain barrier. fact, transporters kidney responsible
shuttling molecules urine, also founded blood-brain barrier
shuttling molecules back bloodstream get across. - Incredible. -
know mental fog one big symptoms kidney disease, potentially
lot metabolites accumulate blood, make way across
blood-brain barrier into, yeah, central nervous system. - Amazing. glad
mentioned mental fog.

01:59:30 Probiotics: Benefits & Risks

years back, reports, scientific reports
consequence media, excessive intake pill-form probiotics create
mental fog. don't know ever took hold. raises general question pill
form probiotics. took years, just thinking good gut
microbiome, switched fermented food thing, largely
consequence work Chris published. thought


probiotics typical person not recovering round antibiotics
prescribed them? heard species microbiota
proliferate might not species want proliferate, also heard
maybe doesn't matter. general stance? can quite
expensive. - Yeah. - Also, know talking expense lot today,
always want take account people showing table variety
budgets, probiotics one expensive supplements there. can
quickly get several hundreds dollars per month getting quote,
unquote, best quality ones. - Right. - actually causing brain fog,
not sure want use them. - No, completely. ton snake oil there.
People know they... think many companies aware can prey
off people's fears get lot money absolutely no data back
probiotic anything. think first thing say buyer beware,
supplement market, largely unregulated. means
lot bad products there, lot products even though not
intended bad, just don't great quality control. several
studies taken off counter, just kind off shelf probiotics,
surveyed based sequencing shown not
match label. - true many supplements, unfortunately
supplement companies. something get podcast lot.
reputable brands go lot work get things right,
many just whatever reason, just doesn't match listed. - Exactly,
places probiotic companies can send product
independently validated. want look sort validation product.
also names just well-known, reputations line,
probably invest little bit quality control maybe other,
lesser-known names. huge range data probiotics. think,
thing kind recommend is, try find good products experiment
see can find something works you. know people
experienced constipation don't want change diet, found probiotic
helps that. can find right mix, great. wonderful.
say data right now not overwhelmingly positive probiotics
gut microbiota. nice studies looking impact probiotics
recovery antibiotic treatment. appears slow recovery


mucosal microbiota. studies big signal isn't seen,
might hope, probiotic supposed treat different disease.
metaanalysis suggest certain instances, recovery antibiotics
there, even though may cause microbiome recover slowly,
may actually prevent diarrheal disease, recovery viral diarrheas, probiotics may
help. huge range products, person
little caper comes microbiome, really hard know whether
great products given indication. really good advice heard
try find study supports in... really well designed study, hard
people aren't scientists evaluate. experiencing medical problem,
want consult doctor, might helpful. finding study
specific probiotic successfully done whatever looking for,
sticking probiotic really best recipe place start space,
think. - prebiotics?

02:04:20 Prebiotics: Essential?

number reasons why, can imagine, prebiotics beneficial?
essentially it's, pushing fiber system, talked lot
today. - Yeah, yeah, absolutely. studies done prebiotics, really
kind mixed bag results. studies done purified fibers
actually see micro biodiversity plummet course study,
get specific bloom small number bacteria good using one
type fiber. expense microbes gut.
really hard replicate purified fiber get, instance, salad
bar, terms array complex carbohydrates exposing
microbiota to. think kind broad view field consuming
broad variety plants, diverse fiber comes probably better
fostering diversity microbiota purified fibers. Now, are, again, lot
people benefit purified fibers, either GI motility aspects GI
health, problems experiencing. Again, think type thing
try find thing right you. also studies
suggest layer rapidly fermentable fibers top Western diet, actually
can result weird metabolism happening liver, incredibly


rapid fermentation fiber along lot fat coming system. least
theory. mouse study published years ago, actually see
subset mice develop hepatocellular carcinoma fed high dose
prebiotic- - Liver cancer. - Liver cancer, top Western diet. whether
representative human biology, don't know, purified fibers definitely
different, terms diversity structures, also terms rapidly
fermented gut. eating plants, complex structures
really slow microbes terms fermentation, end
slow rate fermentation length colon, opposed big burst
fermentation can happen eat something highly soluble easily
accessed microbes. - Interesting, guess,

02:07:00 Tools Enhancing Gut Microbiota

fair come back idea? Try avoid processed foods, highly palatable
foods, sometimes super highly palatable foods. now called,
packed hidden sugars, emulsifiers. sounds like fiber good, despite
outcome study, identified appropriate microbiota
background, one will even better fiber, maybe longer ramp phase
folks, fermented foods. 'Cause no reason can't
both. talked before, lot fermented foods fiber. can
kill two birds one stone. - Totally. diversity increase
saw high fermented food group something aid high fiber
group. now planning another study coming high
fiber, high fermented food, fiber plus fermented food, just see
synergistic effect there. - Great, want enroll, seriously. Although guess biased,
'cause sort know trying to.. Well, blood draws use
