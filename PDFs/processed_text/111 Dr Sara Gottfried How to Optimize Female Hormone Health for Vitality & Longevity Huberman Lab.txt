00:07:50 Women, Family History, Heredity & Environment

Huberman now discussion Dr Sarah Gottfried, Dr Gottfried, Sarah
welcome. Thank happy here, yeah, delighted excited ask
enormous number topics. expert many things
uh. challenge going constrain walk were, hoping
can touch great number things today, first really
hormones female hormones particular - question is: ever
informative woman, regardless age, know something mother's?
Perhaps even grandmother's experience, vis-a-vis hormones, not just pregnancy,
challenges um ease pregnancy child rearing childbirth, sort thing.
know sorts conversations women
family members get window specific needs might love
question, work really interface genetics environment,
question gets think it’s essential understand
grandmother went through. even say great grandmother, depending
longevity family, grew great-grandmother. get
especially mother, probably start first trauma intergenerational
trauma think affects endocrine system hugely especially cortisol
signaling, broader Pine system, psychoimmunuroendocrine system
know think stages. life cycle woman goes through.
think puberty, think don't know genetically determine age
puberty is. Certainly lot environmental influences like toxins can affect it,
um pregnancy. age start go perimenopause menopause,
many genetic component, pregnancy mean can certainly
think shape pelvis, ability vaginal birth.
genetically determined. mean do, know sperm donor affecting


that, know family, instance, no cesarean sections,
everyone goes process relatively easy vaginal birth. forceps
baby, know part um can find
certain female conditions strong component, genetically
run family. includes endometriosis fibroids. just hysterectomy.
added 50 plus fibroids

00:11:00 Puberty, Stress, Menstrual Cycles, Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

polycystic ovarian syndrome three uh. frequent -
maybe can constrain question little bit saying um. Today’s discussion,
imagine, going heard men women sorts Ages, uh, maybe
direct question little bit toward know age discussions start
um? know always imagine women 30s 40s 50s onward
getting certain tests addressing things like uh, ovarian reserve
sorts things. know, maybe March just say
woman teens already hit puberty, sorts biomarkers, whether not
they're, blood-based per um phenotyping. know outward appearance uh.
young women paying attention likewise women 20s 30s?
Maybe take less decade starting puberty, assuming
woman hits puberty sometime between? now? average U.S
somewhere 12 16 years old. right? No, not, oh great,
that’s wrong, used 12 16.. say 50 years ago it’s
moving younger think related toxin exposure, mentioned,
10 went puberty uh well, say menarchy
started growing breasts much that. think now going step away
science moment, going pretty fluidly try call out. think
also huge influence stress like development adrenal glands.
going back science, issue teenage years hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal axis like think broader, stay me. Hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadol, recent women testes men thyroid gut axis.
control system, kind expressing bioengineering side here. Well, think
it’s great include organs tissue systems body, because,


know narrow definition just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal, can't just
right. No, can't no yeah, doesn't tell whole story. look
main sex hormones young woman teenage years, hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadal part not fully mature, likely skip
periods, especially stress lot influences. really doesn't get well
established done adolescence, told adolescence now still
like age 25 26.. heard that, like got two daughters like that’s
really long time not just psychologically defined bio psychosocial, mostly
psychologically defined. heard psychologist, biomarkers asked
teenage years. think really interesting look cortisol look
dance estrogen progesterone years less helpful think
lot variability due immaturity system. got someone,
got really regular periods, it’s probably better benchmarking
age, generally find benchmarking best performed 20s 30s
periods not regular terms duration menstrual cycle. menstrual
cycle first sets depends like clockwork every 28 days
hysterectomy August thing daughters, got two daughters, one's 17,
23. lot women, they're, not regular, whole piece
oral contraceptives forms contraception, no idea
normal cycle - hope time talk little bit oral
contraceptives, think is. now opinion not science. think
number one endocrinopathy iatrogenic women uh. will definitely talk
it. get lot questions oral contraceptives, um social media space
also questions iuds. Quite lot totally particular copper iuds, non-non-
hormonal IUD, will definitely touch that. IUD Crusader, just want
know: give warning fan. right anti?
huge fan iuds particular, like copper, it’s non-hormonal it’s
effective getting tubes dyed. thought right? mean it’s toxic
sperm Mobility. works? That’s understanding
basically it’s like less electric fence sperm cap just
that’s it. Electric fence bit harsh analogy, work that. it’s it’s.
10 years, really complete autonomy sovereignty sexual
life, that’s profound not get Downstream risks, associated
birth control pill. thing that’s important know it. know sidebar


women use copper IUD, highest satisfaction rate anyone
contraceptives, highest satisfaction rate, yet least used forms
contraception. Now favorite vasectomy short vasectomy. think IED
really great choice. risks associated it. not saying it’s risk-free,
love IUD love younger women too, used
went training, 30 years ago, told know, don't put
someone.

00:17:26 Tool: Sex Hormones, Microbiome, Estrobolome & Disease; Biomarker Testing

hasn't baby, patriarchal messaging, getting back
original question, biomarkers per decade 20s? That’s
want base casing estrogen, progesterone testosterone. think
it’s really helpful know this. Tango Argentina father.
Argentine lineage. Yes, grandparents Tango late 80s.
late 40s still haven't started suppose time might time
okay might factor longevity. good health span
grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp died late
90s, um almost burned apartment several times falling asleep
cigarette mouth. don't recommend anyone Smoke way uh,
uh, coffee, mate, uh, red meat cigarettes lived 90s side
family genetic Advantage, side less um, event, uh
Tango. Um 2023 goal. every year, um uh, gon na hold
accountable today, okay, no, will no YouTube. Video
least not initially Tim Ferriss. Actually, phenomenal podcaster, know, uh
badass badass Tango Tango dancer. know various sources.
Yes, yeah, seen yeah, Tango us progesterone incredibly
important. want right lead. want right follow
two hormones? Again, stepping away science hat, happens
lot time estrogen dominates Tango happens, sets
greater risk fibroids endometriosis. Breast pain, probably association
microbiome estrobolume, can familiarize estrobloom yeah,
delighted know don't recognize term yeah, estrobolume set


microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

00:07:50 Women, Family History, Heredity & Environment

Huberman now discussion Dr Sarah Gottfried, Dr Gottfried, Sarah
welcome. Thank happy here, yeah, delighted excited ask
enormous number topics. expert many things
uh. challenge going constrain walk were, hoping
can touch great number things today, first really
hormones female hormones particular - question is: ever
informative woman, regardless age, know something mother's?
Perhaps even grandmother's experience, vis-a-vis hormones, not just pregnancy,
challenges um ease pregnancy child rearing childbirth, sort thing.
know sorts conversations women
family members get window specific needs might love
question, work really interface genetics environment,
question gets think it’s essential understand
grandmother went through. even say great grandmother, depending
longevity family, grew great-grandmother. get
especially mother, probably start first trauma intergenerational
trauma think affects endocrine system hugely especially cortisol
signaling, broader Pine system, psychoimmunuroendocrine system
know think stages. life cycle woman goes through.
think puberty, think don't know genetically determine age
puberty is. Certainly lot environmental influences like toxins can affect it,
um pregnancy. age start go perimenopause menopause,
many genetic component, pregnancy mean can certainly
think shape pelvis, ability vaginal birth.
genetically determined. mean do, know sperm donor affecting


that, know family, instance, no cesarean sections,
everyone goes process relatively easy vaginal birth. forceps
baby, know part um can find
certain female conditions strong component, genetically
run family. includes endometriosis fibroids. just hysterectomy.
added 50 plus fibroids

00:11:00 Puberty, Stress, Menstrual Cycles, Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

polycystic ovarian syndrome three uh. frequent -
maybe can constrain question little bit saying um. Today’s discussion,
imagine, going heard men women sorts Ages, uh, maybe
direct question little bit toward know age discussions start
um? know always imagine women 30s 40s 50s onward
getting certain tests addressing things like uh, ovarian reserve
sorts things. know, maybe March just say
woman teens already hit puberty, sorts biomarkers, whether not
they're, blood-based per um phenotyping. know outward appearance uh.
young women paying attention likewise women 20s 30s?
Maybe take less decade starting puberty, assuming
woman hits puberty sometime between? now? average U.S
somewhere 12 16 years old. right? No, not, oh great,
that’s wrong, used 12 16.. say 50 years ago it’s
moving younger think related toxin exposure, mentioned,
10 went puberty uh well, say menarchy
started growing breasts much that. think now going step away
science moment, going pretty fluidly try call out. think
also huge influence stress like development adrenal glands.
going back science, issue teenage years hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal axis like think broader, stay me. Hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadol, recent women testes men thyroid gut axis.
control system, kind expressing bioengineering side here. Well, think
it’s great include organs tissue systems body, because,


know narrow definition just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal, can't just
right. No, can't no yeah, doesn't tell whole story. look
main sex hormones young woman teenage years, hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadal part not fully mature, likely skip
periods, especially stress lot influences. really doesn't get well
established done adolescence, told adolescence now still
like age 25 26.. heard that, like got two daughters like that’s
really long time not just psychologically defined bio psychosocial, mostly
psychologically defined. heard psychologist, biomarkers asked
teenage years. think really interesting look cortisol look
dance estrogen progesterone years less helpful think
lot variability due immaturity system. got someone,
got really regular periods, it’s probably better benchmarking
age, generally find benchmarking best performed 20s 30s
periods not regular terms duration menstrual cycle. menstrual
cycle first sets depends like clockwork every 28 days
hysterectomy August thing daughters, got two daughters, one's 17,
23. lot women, they're, not regular, whole piece
oral contraceptives forms contraception, no idea
normal cycle - hope time talk little bit oral
contraceptives, think is. now opinion not science. think
number one endocrinopathy iatrogenic women uh. will definitely talk
it. get lot questions oral contraceptives, um social media space
also questions iuds. Quite lot totally particular copper iuds, non-non-
hormonal IUD, will definitely touch that. IUD Crusader, just want
know: give warning fan. right anti?
huge fan iuds particular, like copper, it’s non-hormonal it’s
effective getting tubes dyed. thought right? mean it’s toxic
sperm Mobility. works? That’s understanding
basically it’s like less electric fence sperm cap just
that’s it. Electric fence bit harsh analogy, work that. it’s it’s.
10 years, really complete autonomy sovereignty sexual
life, that’s profound not get Downstream risks, associated
birth control pill. thing that’s important know it. know sidebar


women use copper IUD, highest satisfaction rate anyone
contraceptives, highest satisfaction rate, yet least used forms
contraception. Now favorite vasectomy short vasectomy. think IED
really great choice. risks associated it. not saying it’s risk-free,
love IUD love younger women too, used
went training, 30 years ago, told know, don't put
someone.

00:17:26 Tool: Sex Hormones, Microbiome, Estrobolome & Disease; Biomarker Testing

hasn't baby, patriarchal messaging, getting back
original question, biomarkers per decade 20s? That’s
want base casing estrogen, progesterone testosterone. think
it’s really helpful know this. Tango Argentina father.
Argentine lineage. Yes, grandparents Tango late 80s.
late 40s still haven't started suppose time might time
okay might factor longevity. good health span
grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp died late
90s, um almost burned apartment several times falling asleep
cigarette mouth. don't recommend anyone Smoke way uh,
uh, coffee, mate, uh, red meat cigarettes lived 90s side
family genetic Advantage, side less um, event, uh
Tango. Um 2023 goal. every year, um uh, gon na hold
accountable today, okay, no, will no YouTube. Video
least not initially Tim Ferriss. Actually, phenomenal podcaster, know, uh
badass badass Tango Tango dancer. know various sources.
Yes, yeah, seen yeah, Tango us progesterone incredibly
important. want right lead. want right follow
two hormones? Again, stepping away science hat, happens
lot time estrogen dominates Tango happens, sets
greater risk fibroids endometriosis. Breast pain, probably association
microbiome estrobolume, can familiarize estrobloom yeah,
delighted know don't recognize term yeah, estrobolume set


microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

00:07:50 Women, Family History, Heredity & Environment

Huberman now discussion Dr Sarah Gottfried, Dr Gottfried, Sarah
welcome. Thank happy here, yeah, delighted excited ask
enormous number topics. expert many things
uh. challenge going constrain walk were, hoping
can touch great number things today, first really
hormones female hormones particular - question is: ever
informative woman, regardless age, know something mother's?
Perhaps even grandmother's experience, vis-a-vis hormones, not just pregnancy,
challenges um ease pregnancy child rearing childbirth, sort thing.
know sorts conversations women
family members get window specific needs might love
question, work really interface genetics environment,
question gets think it’s essential understand
grandmother went through. even say great grandmother, depending
longevity family, grew great-grandmother. get
especially mother, probably start first trauma intergenerational
trauma think affects endocrine system hugely especially cortisol
signaling, broader Pine system, psychoimmunuroendocrine system
know think stages. life cycle woman goes through.
think puberty, think don't know genetically determine age
puberty is. Certainly lot environmental influences like toxins can affect it,
um pregnancy. age start go perimenopause menopause,
many genetic component, pregnancy mean can certainly
think shape pelvis, ability vaginal birth.
genetically determined. mean do, know sperm donor affecting


that, know family, instance, no cesarean sections,
everyone goes process relatively easy vaginal birth. forceps
baby, know part um can find
certain female conditions strong component, genetically
run family. includes endometriosis fibroids. just hysterectomy.
added 50 plus fibroids

00:11:00 Puberty, Stress, Menstrual Cycles, Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

polycystic ovarian syndrome three uh. frequent -
maybe can constrain question little bit saying um. Today’s discussion,
imagine, going heard men women sorts Ages, uh, maybe
direct question little bit toward know age discussions start
um? know always imagine women 30s 40s 50s onward
getting certain tests addressing things like uh, ovarian reserve
sorts things. know, maybe March just say
woman teens already hit puberty, sorts biomarkers, whether not
they're, blood-based per um phenotyping. know outward appearance uh.
young women paying attention likewise women 20s 30s?
Maybe take less decade starting puberty, assuming
woman hits puberty sometime between? now? average U.S
somewhere 12 16 years old. right? No, not, oh great,
that’s wrong, used 12 16.. say 50 years ago it’s
moving younger think related toxin exposure, mentioned,
10 went puberty uh well, say menarchy
started growing breasts much that. think now going step away
science moment, going pretty fluidly try call out. think
also huge influence stress like development adrenal glands.
going back science, issue teenage years hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal axis like think broader, stay me. Hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadol, recent women testes men thyroid gut axis.
control system, kind expressing bioengineering side here. Well, think
it’s great include organs tissue systems body, because,


know narrow definition just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal, can't just
right. No, can't no yeah, doesn't tell whole story. look
main sex hormones young woman teenage years, hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadal part not fully mature, likely skip
periods, especially stress lot influences. really doesn't get well
established done adolescence, told adolescence now still
like age 25 26.. heard that, like got two daughters like that’s
really long time not just psychologically defined bio psychosocial, mostly
psychologically defined. heard psychologist, biomarkers asked
teenage years. think really interesting look cortisol look
dance estrogen progesterone years less helpful think
lot variability due immaturity system. got someone,
got really regular periods, it’s probably better benchmarking
age, generally find benchmarking best performed 20s 30s
periods not regular terms duration menstrual cycle. menstrual
cycle first sets depends like clockwork every 28 days
hysterectomy August thing daughters, got two daughters, one's 17,
23. lot women, they're, not regular, whole piece
oral contraceptives forms contraception, no idea
normal cycle - hope time talk little bit oral
contraceptives, think is. now opinion not science. think
number one endocrinopathy iatrogenic women uh. will definitely talk
it. get lot questions oral contraceptives, um social media space
also questions iuds. Quite lot totally particular copper iuds, non-non-
hormonal IUD, will definitely touch that. IUD Crusader, just want
know: give warning fan. right anti?
huge fan iuds particular, like copper, it’s non-hormonal it’s
effective getting tubes dyed. thought right? mean it’s toxic
sperm Mobility. works? That’s understanding
basically it’s like less electric fence sperm cap just
that’s it. Electric fence bit harsh analogy, work that. it’s it’s.
10 years, really complete autonomy sovereignty sexual
life, that’s profound not get Downstream risks, associated
birth control pill. thing that’s important know it. know sidebar


women use copper IUD, highest satisfaction rate anyone
contraceptives, highest satisfaction rate, yet least used forms
contraception. Now favorite vasectomy short vasectomy. think IED
really great choice. risks associated it. not saying it’s risk-free,
love IUD love younger women too, used
went training, 30 years ago, told know, don't put
someone.

00:17:26 Tool: Sex Hormones, Microbiome, Estrobolome & Disease; Biomarker Testing

hasn't baby, patriarchal messaging, getting back
original question, biomarkers per decade 20s? That’s
want base casing estrogen, progesterone testosterone. think
it’s really helpful know this. Tango Argentina father.
Argentine lineage. Yes, grandparents Tango late 80s.
late 40s still haven't started suppose time might time
okay might factor longevity. good health span
grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp died late
90s, um almost burned apartment several times falling asleep
cigarette mouth. don't recommend anyone Smoke way uh,
uh, coffee, mate, uh, red meat cigarettes lived 90s side
family genetic Advantage, side less um, event, uh
Tango. Um 2023 goal. every year, um uh, gon na hold
accountable today, okay, no, will no YouTube. Video
least not initially Tim Ferriss. Actually, phenomenal podcaster, know, uh
badass badass Tango Tango dancer. know various sources.
Yes, yeah, seen yeah, Tango us progesterone incredibly
important. want right lead. want right follow
two hormones? Again, stepping away science hat, happens
lot time estrogen dominates Tango happens, sets
greater risk fibroids endometriosis. Breast pain, probably association
microbiome estrobolume, can familiarize estrobloom yeah,
delighted know don't recognize term yeah, estrobolume set


microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

that, know family, instance, no cesarean sections,
everyone goes process relatively easy vaginal birth. forceps
baby, know part um can find
certain female conditions strong component, genetically
run family. includes endometriosis fibroids. just hysterectomy.
added 50 plus fibroids

00:11:00 Puberty, Stress, Menstrual Cycles, Intrauterine Devices (IUDs)

polycystic ovarian syndrome three uh. frequent -
maybe can constrain question little bit saying um. Today’s discussion,
imagine, going heard men women sorts Ages, uh, maybe
direct question little bit toward know age discussions start
um? know always imagine women 30s 40s 50s onward
getting certain tests addressing things like uh, ovarian reserve
sorts things. know, maybe March just say
woman teens already hit puberty, sorts biomarkers, whether not
they're, blood-based per um phenotyping. know outward appearance uh.
young women paying attention likewise women 20s 30s?
Maybe take less decade starting puberty, assuming
woman hits puberty sometime between? now? average U.S
somewhere 12 16 years old. right? No, not, oh great,
that’s wrong, used 12 16.. say 50 years ago it’s
moving younger think related toxin exposure, mentioned,
10 went puberty uh well, say menarchy
started growing breasts much that. think now going step away
science moment, going pretty fluidly try call out. think
also huge influence stress like development adrenal glands.
going back science, issue teenage years hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal axis like think broader, stay me. Hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadol, recent women testes men thyroid gut axis.
control system, kind expressing bioengineering side here. Well, think
it’s great include organs tissue systems body, because,


know narrow definition just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal, can't just
right. No, can't no yeah, doesn't tell whole story. look
main sex hormones young woman teenage years, hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadal part not fully mature, likely skip
periods, especially stress lot influences. really doesn't get well
established done adolescence, told adolescence now still
like age 25 26.. heard that, like got two daughters like that’s
really long time not just psychologically defined bio psychosocial, mostly
psychologically defined. heard psychologist, biomarkers asked
teenage years. think really interesting look cortisol look
dance estrogen progesterone years less helpful think
lot variability due immaturity system. got someone,
got really regular periods, it’s probably better benchmarking
age, generally find benchmarking best performed 20s 30s
periods not regular terms duration menstrual cycle. menstrual
cycle first sets depends like clockwork every 28 days
hysterectomy August thing daughters, got two daughters, one's 17,
23. lot women, they're, not regular, whole piece
oral contraceptives forms contraception, no idea
normal cycle - hope time talk little bit oral
contraceptives, think is. now opinion not science. think
number one endocrinopathy iatrogenic women uh. will definitely talk
it. get lot questions oral contraceptives, um social media space
also questions iuds. Quite lot totally particular copper iuds, non-non-
hormonal IUD, will definitely touch that. IUD Crusader, just want
know: give warning fan. right anti?
huge fan iuds particular, like copper, it’s non-hormonal it’s
effective getting tubes dyed. thought right? mean it’s toxic
sperm Mobility. works? That’s understanding
basically it’s like less electric fence sperm cap just
that’s it. Electric fence bit harsh analogy, work that. it’s it’s.
10 years, really complete autonomy sovereignty sexual
life, that’s profound not get Downstream risks, associated
birth control pill. thing that’s important know it. know sidebar


women use copper IUD, highest satisfaction rate anyone
contraceptives, highest satisfaction rate, yet least used forms
contraception. Now favorite vasectomy short vasectomy. think IED
really great choice. risks associated it. not saying it’s risk-free,
love IUD love younger women too, used
went training, 30 years ago, told know, don't put
someone.

00:17:26 Tool: Sex Hormones, Microbiome, Estrobolome & Disease; Biomarker Testing

hasn't baby, patriarchal messaging, getting back
original question, biomarkers per decade 20s? That’s
want base casing estrogen, progesterone testosterone. think
it’s really helpful know this. Tango Argentina father.
Argentine lineage. Yes, grandparents Tango late 80s.
late 40s still haven't started suppose time might time
okay might factor longevity. good health span
grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp died late
90s, um almost burned apartment several times falling asleep
cigarette mouth. don't recommend anyone Smoke way uh,
uh, coffee, mate, uh, red meat cigarettes lived 90s side
family genetic Advantage, side less um, event, uh
Tango. Um 2023 goal. every year, um uh, gon na hold
accountable today, okay, no, will no YouTube. Video
least not initially Tim Ferriss. Actually, phenomenal podcaster, know, uh
badass badass Tango Tango dancer. know various sources.
Yes, yeah, seen yeah, Tango us progesterone incredibly
important. want right lead. want right follow
two hormones? Again, stepping away science hat, happens
lot time estrogen dominates Tango happens, sets
greater risk fibroids endometriosis. Breast pain, probably association
microbiome estrobolume, can familiarize estrobloom yeah,
delighted know don't recognize term yeah, estrobolume set


microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

know narrow definition just hypothalamic pituitary adrenal, can't just
right. No, can't no yeah, doesn't tell whole story. look
main sex hormones young woman teenage years, hypothalamic
pituitary adrenal gonadal part not fully mature, likely skip
periods, especially stress lot influences. really doesn't get well
established done adolescence, told adolescence now still
like age 25 26.. heard that, like got two daughters like that’s
really long time not just psychologically defined bio psychosocial, mostly
psychologically defined. heard psychologist, biomarkers asked
teenage years. think really interesting look cortisol look
dance estrogen progesterone years less helpful think
lot variability due immaturity system. got someone,
got really regular periods, it’s probably better benchmarking
age, generally find benchmarking best performed 20s 30s
periods not regular terms duration menstrual cycle. menstrual
cycle first sets depends like clockwork every 28 days
hysterectomy August thing daughters, got two daughters, one's 17,
23. lot women, they're, not regular, whole piece
oral contraceptives forms contraception, no idea
normal cycle - hope time talk little bit oral
contraceptives, think is. now opinion not science. think
number one endocrinopathy iatrogenic women uh. will definitely talk
it. get lot questions oral contraceptives, um social media space
also questions iuds. Quite lot totally particular copper iuds, non-non-
hormonal IUD, will definitely touch that. IUD Crusader, just want
know: give warning fan. right anti?
huge fan iuds particular, like copper, it’s non-hormonal it’s
effective getting tubes dyed. thought right? mean it’s toxic
sperm Mobility. works? That’s understanding
basically it’s like less electric fence sperm cap just
that’s it. Electric fence bit harsh analogy, work that. it’s it’s.
10 years, really complete autonomy sovereignty sexual
life, that’s profound not get Downstream risks, associated
birth control pill. thing that’s important know it. know sidebar


women use copper IUD, highest satisfaction rate anyone
contraceptives, highest satisfaction rate, yet least used forms
contraception. Now favorite vasectomy short vasectomy. think IED
really great choice. risks associated it. not saying it’s risk-free,
love IUD love younger women too, used
went training, 30 years ago, told know, don't put
someone.

microbiome estrobolume, can familiarize estrobloom yeah,
delighted know don't recognize term yeah, estrobolume set


microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones

01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

women use copper IUD, highest satisfaction rate anyone
contraceptives, highest satisfaction rate, yet least used forms
contraception. Now favorite vasectomy short vasectomy. think IED
really great choice. risks associated it. not saying it’s risk-free,
love IUD love younger women too, used
went training, 30 years ago, told know, don't put
someone.

00:17:26 Tool: Sex Hormones, Microbiome, Estrobolome & Disease; Biomarker Testing

hasn't baby, patriarchal messaging, getting back
original question, biomarkers per decade 20s? That’s
want base casing estrogen, progesterone testosterone. think
it’s really helpful know this. Tango Argentina father.
Argentine lineage. Yes, grandparents Tango late 80s.
late 40s still haven't started suppose time might time
okay might factor longevity. good health span
grandfather Smoked Cigarettes daily remained mentally sharp died late
90s, um almost burned apartment several times falling asleep
cigarette mouth. don't recommend anyone Smoke way uh,
uh, coffee, mate, uh, red meat cigarettes lived 90s side
family genetic Advantage, side less um, event, uh
Tango. Um 2023 goal. every year, um uh, gon na hold
accountable today, okay, no, will no YouTube. Video
least not initially Tim Ferriss. Actually, phenomenal podcaster, know, uh
badass badass Tango Tango dancer. know various sources.
Yes, yeah, seen yeah, Tango us progesterone incredibly
important. want right lead. want right follow
two hormones? Again, stepping away science hat, happens
lot time estrogen dominates Tango happens, sets
greater risk fibroids endometriosis. Breast pain, probably association
microbiome estrobolume, can familiarize estrobloom yeah,
delighted know don't recognize term yeah, estrobolume set


microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

cost effective biologically Effective supplement regimen, that’s
hard blends supplements, it’s straightforward single
ingredient formulations, also momentous supplements ship internationally,
important realize many reside outside United States.
like see supplements discussed Huberman Lab podcast, can go
live, momentous, spelled ous, that’s livemomentis.com Huberman. Thank

microbes DNA DNA, mostly gut microbiome. set
microbes DNA, it’s the. look totality, subset particular
bacteria modulate estrogen levels. lot work spearheaded Martin
Glaser, know women estrobolume
makes greater risk certain estrogen mediated conditions like breast
cancer, endometrial cancer men prostate cancer. estrobulum incredibly
important. not lot attention paid it, always think terms
patients know, someone got faulty, strobe need
adjust with. know microbiome modulating uh nutrients nutraceuticals
less likely Tango, that’s not working
estrogen progesterone, getting back biomarkers. If, gave unlimited
budget, kind um clients work now,
want know estrogen progesterone testosterone, want timing right
that. want know DHEA sort whole Anderson pathway. want
know metabolites estrogen, protective
helpful. Others bit like Homer Simpson. mean just like causing
kinds problems body: increasing risk Quinones like DNA damage
potentially increased risk breast cancer. Although data, think, mixed.
also like know stool. want know microbiome, best
right now look uh. stool testing, lot stool testing.
can look things like beta glucoronidase. familiar BG, familiar
it? term listening often not always hear ace,
ASE dealing enzyme, can take stab - sounds like
it’s somehow involved um glucose metabolism sort Clickeronautation,
it’s involved produce estrogen body. like simplified
version, produce estrogen, meant use like, send
receptors it’s meant go lose like. don't want keep
recirculating estrogen like Bad Karma that’s happens people
high blade beta gluconidase. it’s enzyme, that’s produced three bacteria,
particular gut, see lot men women elevated beta
glucuronidase estrogen dominance related to.
total reason don't really know, it’s one drivers, it’s one levers
can detected microbiome, AKA stool sample, that’s right terms blood
testing various tests. biomarkers, getting estrogen, testosterone


ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones

01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

ratios realize people different means financial means,
general people wanting blood test. sounds like going need it.
women will need different stages menstrual cycle
pick one, know either follicular phase luteal stage ovarian
menstrual cycle. Excuse ovulatory, menstrual cycle. suggest
pick one? forced pick one, say probably day
21 22 someone 20s, focused right now decade.
women got menstrual cycle, Dave averages 28 days,
week start period women irregular. It’s harder
women get older talk moment. Usually cycle gets
little shorter, start decline progesterone production, period gets
little closer together, like mine August, every 26 days.
point want test sooner like day 1920 not talking blood tests.
blood test cheapest thing. It’s usually What’s covered insurance,
preference dried urine. like use saliva cortisol. like use dried
urine get metabolomics addition levels hormones
forced use blood testing, that’s certainly gold standard
hormones talking um. It’s not comprehensive and, know,
it’s quick little snapshot needle's vein, know, 30 seconds yeah.
salivary cortisol makes sense understanding get free
cortisol, active cortisol. said urine also getting
metabolites, that’s right um blood testing you're, getting it’s sort crude
window

00:25:11 Nutritional Testing; Vegetables, Microbiome & Disease

Averages ecstatic total level uh. Let go back say one thing
biomarkers, big part testing phenotyping, patients, practice
Precision medicine. like almost start nutritional testing. don't think ever
teenager. got NBA players 19, 20 21, maybe count
uh. men obviously, nutritional testing. potentially
helpful thing 20s becomes less important. get older
develop micronutrient deficiencies, micronutrients play huge role terms


hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla
berries sort thing. can go long way don't like vegetables
short that, say supplements, say that’s distant second
making smoothie. got one patient mention um took us


extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

hormone production. Magnesium. know Magnesium hugely involved
way get rid estrogen example, micronutrient testing. usually
combination blood urine, looking micronutrients
can measure clinical scientific basis behind them.
teenager, think might helpful recently gave lecture breast
cancer risk reduction. Another quick sidebar sad find intake
vegetables polyphenols important predictor. future risk breast cancer like
50, 60 plus important time teenager. Now
one daughter eats vegetables, loves another daughter
eats food. That’s beige it’s hard get eat volume vegetables.
know five colors day, do, evidence
show 17 year old, got micronutrient gaps. think motivator
eat differently time it’s critical, even though it’s know 25
years future it’s going potentially change Arc on.
young woman doesn't like vegetables not somehow able
willing get five colors day vegetable help support microbiome?
know supplements useful tool case um. sorts tools,
Behavioral otherwise, useful, good question, going invoke
Rob Knight UCSD, think uh, gut project really helpful terms
understanding kind modulators going Important, try get
person - don't see many teens anymore NBA players.
try get smoothie hard get smoothie
every day. get smoothie three times week throw
vegetables makes huge difference. mean know makes
difference terms microbiome change. blending broccoli kale
cauliflower. cauliflower great, even they're, putting things Smoothie yeah.
don't know can get teenager that, often will use like. them.
steamed broccoli, that’s freezer, it’s got little taste
chocolate smoothie. add greens, I, like greens,
powders, super convenient that, you, know, kind taste like
whether that’s chocolate, clients want, know, vanilla

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones

01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

extreme, retired physicist, professor UCSD. found
microbiome hot mess developed autoimmune disease, became
hell-bent like physicist. changing microbiome dramatically
shifted smoothie every day 57 vegetables fruits it? 57
independent 57 independent. mean just warms heart, way
this, go farmer's market. just get bunch this, bunch
go home, make smoothie stick freezer.
serving every day became completely different person. Based
microbiome change. uh autoimmune disease remission. um dropped
huge amount weight. went know, kind phenotype
know know well professor High performing traveling around world
many boards, much Innovation, many great ideas, super computer guy
someone gets morning gets hot tub exercises like one two
hours day little work like completely shifted way lives
microbiome shift. know knows What’s chicken
What’s egg there, huge change physiology. Glucose went
quite high, tracks this. course it’s like Jupiter, all, right
retired. suppose might retired, he's, got longest
time series anyone. know tracked glucose Insulin going back 20
years, can show you, okay. started smoothie

00:31:13 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

glucose Insulin changed result like take quick
break acknowledge one sponsors athletic greens athletic greens now called
ag1 vitamin mineral probiotic drink covers foundational nutritional
needs taking athletic greens since 2012 delighted
sponsoring podcast reason started taking athletic greens reason still
take athletic greens usually twice day gets probiotics
need gut health gut important it’s populated gut microbiota
communicate brain immune system basically biological systems
body strongly impact immediate long-term health probiotics
athletic greens optimal vital microbiotic health addition athletic greens


contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

contains number adaptogens vitamins minerals make sure
foundational nutritional needs met tastes great like try athletic
greens can go athleticgreens.com Huberman give five free travel
packs make really easy mix athletic greens road
car plane Etc give

00:32:22 Microbiome, Prebiotics & Probiotics, Inflammation

year's supply vitamin d3k2. Again, that’s athleticgreens.com Huberman get
five free travel packs year supply vitamin D3 K2. case say
young women, young women men using over-the-counter probiotics way
enhance microbiome? something hear lot. heard excessive
doses capsule probiotics can give brain fog like condition. personally don't use
capsule probiotics unless feel like system, significant amount stress,
case might add brief periods time just taken antibiotics
period time, ever recommend College student high school
student take capsule probiotics, assuming getting say
three five servings vegetables per day, either smoothie form form.
thoughts supplementing probiotics? sounds like simple
question. complex answer don't think really answer
tell way approach it. look randomized trials support use
probiotics and, frankly, underwhelmed. seen data. invoke um
NBA players moment, almost every player tested increased intestinal
permeability. just high training load, probably mediated cortisol
high glucosis drain increased intestinal permeability.
tight junctions intestine become loose. develop lot inflammation
result you're, professional MBA player making 20
million year like you, don't want lot inflammation. want little bit like help
muscles recover, don't want um, adding problems
develop injury, leaky gut leaky gut yeah. don't love term, yeah
use here. particular probiotic helpful athletes leaky
gut. that’s kind specificity randomized trial looking rest it.
think support find help described. take course
antibiotics, mean first all, question whether need them, try


avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

avoid them. instances prescribed took
mostly past. college. seem like kind gave out.
sinus infection give Pro, know antibiotics using like yeah worst
treatment ever yeah. So, coming off antibiotics, think that’s good time
call replacement dose. Probiotics, think, What’s far interesting
prebiotics. think data much better prebiotics um selective use
polyphenols. person teens 20s age matter, know
whether not nutritional deficiencies? best way analyze
one getting enough magnesium matter, going best way
test microbiome? said stool sample come right back
question, asked blood test. time day when, month, um
establish baseline, prior embarking know, 97 vegetables,
many years per day 57.. Well, love idea telling us gathering
correctly, that? Yes, case probiotics, typical person, regardless
age, eating vegetables drinking vegetables, case may be,
going beneficial gut microbiome. Perhaps without need go test.
Whether not one making certain

00:36:08 Microbiome Testing, Magnesium, Constipation & Thyroid

Number estrogen related metabolites not just that’s great starting Place, eat
consume vegetables um. one wants analyze gut microbiome,
good tests available general public? not going name
companies, tracking years, it’s never clear
know constituents gut microbiome best. know
dysbiosis bad yeah know diversity microbiome good. hear
yeah, no one's ever told want particular ratio one microbiota
another right way made sense least totally not
microbiologist, whereas, know, testosterone men, Hear: okay,
want free testosterone two percent total. Perhaps
women you, women gon na, testosterone estrogen average,
still less men look testosterone, etc, etc, can kind get some.
crude measures, microbiome just seems like long lists microbiota,


just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s

just get dizzy. just just wrote bunch I's L's s's you'd.
can go halfway bit bit information, not trying poke field. It’s
beautiful field, haven't told microbiota look
like like. What’s healthy microbiome chart? Well, that’s don't know, mean
best Rob Knight's work, even limited terms know. Can
tell woman 20s particular pattern
microbiome? No, can't um. Let go first question think just
asked six. first question nutritional testing. like
nutritional testing run panel. That’s looking antioxidants like vitamin vitamin C
alpha, lipoic acid, um plant-based antioxidants, can measure
blood like look key vitamins, especially B vitamin range because,
probably know, got particular Genetic um polymorphism, might
less likely absorbing right level vitamin B9 folate, vitamin, B12, Etc.
also looking going back antioxidants glutathione think that’s
important lever comes detoxification, haven't talked yet
looking Minerals. Magnesium really important
know somewhere around 788 Americans deficient magnesium. That’s like
lowest hanging fruit. curious, instance, like magnesium,
number people deficient. mean number people
targeting nutrition towards foods contain magnesium supplementing
magnesium? so, forms magnesium talked about? Mag, three
eight Sleep, Mexican many forms can little bit
overwhelming people. detail sourcing appreciate great so, first
terms testing, prefer mention one one lab
one brand um, can just speaking mostly experience uh testing.
lot Genova neutrals pandemic. developed at-home test,
normally neutral valve, get blood drawn
urine sample. lot people can't that. great thing test
insurance usually pays it, copay 150 dollars.
pandemic developed another test called metabolomics, much
testing, it’s finger prick. patients prefer fact haven't
gone back nutribal. Second lab spectracell. use Spectra cell occasionally. find
not quite easy terms fitting practice, got friends mentors
like Mark Houston. lot kind Precision, cardiometabolic Health?


thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust

immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

thinks spectrosol best test there. asked magnesium,
measure red blood cell magnesium like whole blood deficiency. It’s interesting
supplementation patients, tend toward constipation that’s frankly,
80 percent women take care really, yes, wow curious
um I, can guess, diet, stress, um, patriarchy rage psychosis
Pine, um, pine system right psychology, Immunology neural endocrine
factors combined. yes, say, another Factor
female health hazard. twice rate depression. Insomnia.
got three four x: increased risk multiple sclerosis. got five eight
times risk thyroid dysfunction. just look look subtle,
pre-clinical thyroid dysfunction, huge number women take care of. Well, let
back off large number women take. Care thyroid dysfunction,
that’s contributing constipation, go back control system,
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal thyroid Canal gut axis, lot perceived
stress together borderline thyroid function no mainstream medicine doctor
told problem, got problem Tango
estrogen progesterone she's, going tend toward constipation women lot
constipation men. gut 10 feet longer women compared
men. talk sex gender differences Define sure,
much likely torturous colon

00:42:25 Female Colonoscopy; Network Effect & Modern Medicine, Stress Factors

way know that, get colonoscopy tell yeah it’s really
hard like get need brief tangent. think
time ask um age now Physicians insist female patients get
colonoscopies men. think age used 50. Now it’s getting ratcheted back
45 40.. Again, recommendations, not requirements, they're. Pretty
strong recommendations depending live, Etc, um women.
early think get colonoscopy explore possible polyps
colon cancer? Yeah? It’s really good question. don't know answer,
always operated 50.. way answer, is, go U.S preventive
task force rating determine, based synthesis data. age


appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

appropriate? changed, just described, men 50 younger? don't
know so. fact check um additional health hazards women
um - mentioned broadly mentioned psychological impact right and,
course, things related psychology, immunology one the, think,
wonderful things neuroscience Science general medicine
now understanding organs connected one another: it’s network,
it’s network microbiome sits um key node within Network
um, think people accept now. Yes, yeah. seems theme that,
least last 10 years really wonderful um certainly Neuroscience.
thought know unless it’s cranial vault, it’s not neural,
ridiculous, lots nervous system outside skull. case, can
interrupt second? Yes, please, think right understanding
network effect, think much love mainstream medicine
trained grateful education, still think silo based way
taking Care patients, even understanding network effect
science level described Neuroscience, still, know
woman constipation fatigue um, maybe autoimmune condition feel stressed
time feel, Like hormones whack get sent
gastroenterologist constipation get sent rheumatologist
autoimmune issues. maybe get sent endocrinologist got thyroid
problems little collaboration groups.

00:45:13 Constipation, Stress & Trauma, Autonomic Balance

Even though understanding network effect real life, it’s not
happening. um, go deeper path, point something
really important mentioned constipation times. Can view
constipation serious enough symptom warrants immediate intervention
is, flag signal problems severe enough,
issue? That’s dealt uh anybody. That’s experiencing yeah mean sort
odd topic many people think, oh know. Bowel movements
sort know kind um pre-adolescent humor around this, think it’s
it’s important you're. hearing say constipation far
common women signals general many problems occurring. mean


women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust

immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

women address constipation so, What’s best way address
constipation yeah? love question can quick little
meta conversation something knew do,
teaching something changing like social genomics thing
happening changing thought this. just wanted
acknowledge that. Thank you. Thank you. Well, think know hear
kind know, talking phenotype constipation phenotype.
It’s one people generally don't wear t-shirt explaining people,
guessing anything sexual health, um, bowel Health, Urology people, just don't
talk right, um sorts reasons, reasons probably obvious
not Even worth discussing, also won't change
except talking yep. say um, women far
constipated that’s signaling larger set problems. Yes, then, immediate
thought well: will relieving constipation um pun uh intended retroactively um. Will
assist great number issues, will get road thinking
issues? specifically like need magnesium,
putting vegetables smoothie, know curious constipation
Target yeah intervention. That, then, opens bunch discussions,
certain nodes mental health, physical health space
someone know like, talk lot deliberate cold exposure. think it’s
magic? No, think that, someone's getting cold shower
day, opens nun, number questions reveals number
things like buffer stress, yeah, sorts levels control
do? actually have, perhaps not best example, us
hate cold exposure right, have. like gene makes us stress
out, like wouldn't believe, argue, makes um likely even 10
seconds cold exposure gets you. effect want, opposed someone
adores cold exposure like penguin needs. lot cold exposure
Adaptive response. Anyway, that’s way gumbing uh, quite uh,
you're, quite correct um. so, answer questions. Constipation issue
yeah. changing way think this, asking okay,
instead looking constipation constellation symptoms. about, just
used sort um, key indicator signal dysfunction
network maybe something broader, think that’s right, makes think


things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

things. makes you're. Also changing book writing autoimmunity
Trauma. thank that. women experience trauma men.
well established. look ace studies done CDC Kaiser
1998, know men, part, middle-aged men, um 50
experience significant trauma, defined ace questionnaire. Women
60 that’s pretty durable since 1998., women more, different
forms abuse, much likely sexual abuse. different HPA
response men, perceived stress tends higher generalizing.
population side. Note know Precision medicine, don't medicine
individual individual, not population, not medicine average. so,
look physiology female, think constipation need like
control restrain hold things know, tighten anal sphincter. think that’s
part physiology, veering away science, think
really important signal pay lot attention now. also asked microbiome
testing. yeah? Well, couple questions
constipation. never thought ask many questions concentrating, now
fascinated way. Also morning taught medical students Stanford
fact basically series tubes. talked anal
sphincter. set sphincters one end. mean set
tubes, nervous system one tubes well - think eastern
medicine, talk various locks tubes Chambers, it’s
not without coincidence, real wisdom there. course wait: just talk
energetic Anatomy, uh less? didn't say word chakras, uh,
might passage it’s bondas right sphincters? Yes, yes,
that’s right. Uh! Thank that. um, defines constipation mean,
words, think healthy, rather thinking unhealthy. Let'S,
many bowel movements woman man per day assuming
gets tricky, people time restricted feeding people
eating more. people eat fiber, bulk, larger meal. end
day, larger meal, beginning day, will never um, able sort
variables, average um many bowel movements timing
day bowel movements informative. works um? Well,
asleep um generally, don't want bowel movement, going like people
right. Well, sleep primary right exactly um. always assumed morning time


yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

yeah healthy time bowel movements. Um think almost everybody
babies included, recognize feeling lighter energetic
evacuated totally colon, totally um, fact, much obsessed jungian
Freudian psychology first thing learn come world Right
want something feel sort autonomic arousal stress, whether
not it’s food warmth, need bowel movement. One first things
parents learn recognize not odor. Coming diaper,
look baby's face agitation agitation signals need sort
relief, right temperature relief, food relief, um evacuating bowel relief.
understanding autonomic arousal increases early part day, ideally
good night's sleep bowel movements become likely unless arousal
becomes great that, people feel quote: unquote locked right um
balance autonomics features early day, guessing
second half day, totally guessing um certainly not wake
middle night um yeah. best guesses, that’s great,
agree that. Harvard Medical School UCSF residency,
taught constipation bowel movement less frequently whenever
every three days. don't think ever laughed loud podcast
consequence uh textbook medical knowledge. kidding me?
ridiculous? Well, sounds like, and, pun intended, sounds like uh,
conclusion um constipated personally ways,
constipated individuals might seem like odd conversation,
discussion around conservation present psychological literature, yes,
relationship autonomic system - well, it’s metaphor literature, it’s crucial!
spoke number different threads think important here.
that’s definition learned heard like hell. No,
doesn't work me. doesn't work anyone. know - spent lot time,
especially medical school internship, rotate medicine,
disimpacting women like older women come in, haven't, bowel
movement month whoa, that, let tell not Nice anybody yeah
believe me. became scientist, not physician number reasons, positive
negative. That’s one yeah, definition constipation western,
mostly white girl, not bowel movement every single morning -
feeling complete evacuation, anything less constipation.


that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

that’s Define it. India eating food, that’s got fair amount
microbes it. It’s less. know sanitary, using word um carefully
can. Generally. bowel movement every meal, got
different microbiome exposed different microbes U.S, say
Wednesday. also spoke something important, balance
parasympathetic nervous system rest digest poop versus sympathetic
nervous system kind button. know fight flight freeze spawn, think
us who've got

00:55:35 Constipation Relief, Stress, Breathwork & Meditation

Issues autonomic balance can lead constipation, like constipation
pulled kind writ larger important signal. sorts tools
recommend? People use um, relieve constipation um eating fiber sounds
like reducing stress. going huge one? Yes, favorite stress
reduction tools? Um like divide real-time tools, big proponent like
physiological sign real time. know sorts things, things can really
lower Baseline stress overall facilitate constipation broad
indicators Health. not fan lowering stress, fan lowering perceived
stress think distinction really important. learned 30s
massive stress case didn't know it. just sort think
residency working 120 hours week. just accustomed sort um
120, not 20 folks yeah, not unusual medicine. Well,
changed training work no 80 hours week now,
time. became accustomed massive amount cortisol massive
say, spent past 20 years really working perceived stress find, think,
us cart menu effective. works now age
different know. TM college student Transcendental
Meditation it’s different became certified yoga teacher 30s
effective lot people. wasn't enough Matrix. holotropic
breath work um. didn't read it, saw it. just paper sell sign
um. kind made think like teach teach teach sigh like.
Can say little bit like? yeah? briefly, study
we. wanted find minimal, effective dose intervention yeah. just wanted


yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

yeah. five minutes day. need figure people every day yeah
monitoring, subjective mood, Etc, also Biometrics remotely. it’s kind
nice Biometrics, HRV HRV uh nighttime sleep, cortisol uh. wish um. done
pandemic. 100 subjects, advantage got data 24
hours day pinging us data uh wearing HRV, 24 yeah nice.
nice resting, heart rate, um subjective mood. get touch
daily. people swapped groups like good study, five
minutes day sort standard, will forgive me, meditations just sitting no
instructions breathe just focusing um closing eyes focusing
focusing yep um. Another group box, breathing yep inhale, hold exhale hold equal
durations. duration inhales holds set carbon
dioxide tolerance somewhere three eight seconds, depending
well regulate carbon dioxide. Another group cyclic signs,
double inhale nose, big inhale nose followed lungs,
empty exhale second inhale first big long inhale nose really
important makes sure Collapsed abiola, lungs totally snap
open exhale offload lot carbon dioxide. That’s similar
holotropic breath work. Not yes, not not. Um not unlike holotropic, breath little bit
pranayama-ish, exhale rather passive opposed active fourth
category cyclic hyperventilation, lot like Tumo AKA, Wim Hof, ish
breathing different Wim Hof breathing. active, inhales
exhales. Every 25 cycles inhale exhale that'll one cycle. Long exhale hold lungs
empty 15 30 seconds, repeat five minutes now info. Everyone
five minutes found cyclic sign led greatest
improvements mood Around Clock, not just around practice
practice, well lowered, resting heart rate, improvements sleep, Etc. got
it, publish sell yeah. amazing, fortunate. think um,
thankfully reviewers editors understood minimal intervention things
uh, hopefully going use people useful people mean. often
read paper like offer behavior change? easy
implement. mean love question. Thank you. about? tell not
drink, alcohol huge effect HRV yeah? case didn't
tell alter anything else behavior. Just hoping background kind
across system. Yes, Stanford students, others


general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

general population, Frat Boys drinking heavily, probably not well
pandemic. think alcohol intake went way way across board. Um, mean, isn't
magic wand, ask people either not drink drink. Two
drinks per week, maximum least that’s understanding literature um.
familiar whoop data alcohol? No, collaboration
paper, yeah um certainly disrupts patterns nighttime sleep, particular
understanding first phase sleep, that’s related massive growth
hormone release really need want different measure, growth
Hormones not. No. second iteration study will certainly include free
cortisol saliva hormone panels. Well, beginning think also um
asking people often going bathroom time day. Yes,
mean thing around constipation uh super interesting think plus um
blood markers excited learn um. urine contains
additional markers informative, yeah was. fun study. Uh not
easy study number subjects. Um takes lot training
research assistants yeah. big group. nine people group three
clinicians lot lot phone calls lot back forth, know
thank subjects served uh, real life guinea pigs yeah. think
stress know people's. think people starting appreciate
ways can relieve stress, don't fall categories
vacation right meditation, want say meditation obviously wonderful
tool. Um, it’s just it’s it’s tool, not unlike tool great people
less great others. Well, certainly it’s great tool it’s got scientific
basis behind it, many things la carte

01:02:58 Systemic & Societal Stress Unique Females

Menu sex, orgasm, um connection, feeling heard seen loved um yeah.
talk that. know mentioned earlier stress factors said
patriarchy right yeah, think may um risk uh, just strengthening
uh statement. mean is, signaling bunch factors around us.
said like keeping keeping things um. think explains? talk
think that’s likely raised certain flag people's minds like


exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate

Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

exactly talking about? talking less opportunity?
talking less opportunity um vocalize? talking less opportunity
vocalize heard? mean realize infinite number variables,
given sounds like really strong input system, uh, mean
psychology influencing biology you're, saying uh,
power power dynamics Structures Dynamics impacting I'd. Love. hear
thoughts that, uh hate let flag like go without fleshing
never waste good flag. Well preface just saying that, like
people will different opinions that’s think that’s healthy like
discussion constipation, talk people aren't willing talk
comes health love it. might need talk patriarchy part
two, give material working with. started. not even
understand existence patriarchy bioengineering undergraduate
MIT. mention always bit male um askewed male
terms Faculty numbers. Well, that’s true universities, true well,
postdoc advisor late Ben Barris, female male transition,
transgender interest. First, transgender member National Academy Sciences
closest friends. Unfortunately, died pancreatic cancer. very,
close they're, actually making documentary Ben Ben. interesting.
Ben went MIT wanted around lot men - yeah, that’s lesser
known fact, strong advocate women. went Barbara
Barbara um way, given permission share
prior death. recorded lot conversations yeah um. ever knew
Ben way, MIT, identified female later talked
intense um suppression. Oppression literally, described it, especially
given performing well. Yes, just defined patriarchy,
yourself, couple things bioengineering. took women's studies class
teaching undergraduates existence patriarchy,
Define, maybe simplest power not saying men patriarchy,
saying something different, power over. Let correct one thing
said didn't go MIT undergraduate, Alaska, went
University Washington bioengineering Seattle Seattle. Okay, dropped
graduate program bioengineering go Harvard MIT program Health
Sciences technology Boston. Thanks clarification, University


Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set
might make us makes right generally people strongest.
know big men, strong men ones tend successful
people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

Washington also wonderful place. many many many many many many many
wonderful, close colleagues there. It’s incredible place, especially vision, science,
it’s especially good engineering bioengineering um yeah, MD jointly
MIT Harvard, it’s oldest, maybe largest, although Harvard says
lot program biomedical engineers uh MD phds. Physician scientist training
program - great thanks clarification, going blame internet one.
am, think need send Wikipedia editors there. think LinkedIn
correct. Okay, great well Wikipedia editors, note get make make
correction. Now heard um stress really talking
systemic stress body concept, consequence. Excuse systemic
stress environment. That’s right, know particular forms it. say
also relates White Privilege. relates racism look you, know
kind way systems, including beloved MIT, way set

people bipoc people don't white privilege women.

01:08:19 InsideTracker

it’s different experience using patriarchy kind umbrella
connects many things like take brief break thank sponsor inside
tracker inside tracker personalized nutrition platform analyzes data
blood DNA help better understand body help reach health
goals long believer getting regular blood work done simple reason
many factors impact immediate long-term Health can
analyzed quality blood test problem lot blood DNA tests
however get data back metabolic factors lipids hormones
forth don't know data insidetracker solves problem
makes easy understand sorts nutritional behavioral maybe
even supplementation based interventions might want take order adjust
numbers metabolic factors hormones lipids things impact
immediate long-term Health bring numbers ranges
appropriate indeed optimal



01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

01:09:23 Testing & Future Behavior

like try inside tracker, can visit insidetracker.com Huberman get 20 off
inside hackers plans. That’s inside tracker.com Huberman get twenty percent
off. want use opportunity keep mind. return question
didn't close hatch earlier it’s fault, now clear fact
woman late teens early 20s, know something
testosterone, estrogen thyroid cortisol levels start Least, thinking
microbiome thinking many bowel movements timing
bowel movements per day really I'm, assuming just described
also true women 20s 30s 40s 50s. hundreds. correct, that’s
correct, say differential opportunities decade. glad
circled back teenagers testosterone, think, know,
instance, teenage years, high androgens got
potential phenotype way future may not even notice. mean. Maybe
notice got extra hairs chin something know
testosterone elevated androgen, might change Arc
take care yourself. think helpful teenage years
20s people, stress case like age 27, words UCSF.
known high cortisol person, think done things differently.
changed behavior don't know didn't base case these,
testosterone can decline, starting 20s kind of, depending much
stress Matrix women can start early 28. Usually
testosterone declines one percent per year. level testosterone
like see woman sort post, say age 25? kind range
healthy? know reference range know one look up.
don't know it’s off top head immediately, What’s kind nice
reference point there? way tend describe podcasts top

01:11:55 Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) & Cardiometabolic Disease; Stress

Half normal range great think, good benchmark. know PCOS


generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

generally it’s much higher that. know seen patients PCOS,
total testosterone 100 200.. always peripheral manifestations that?
little bit hair, skin plaques heard know darkened skin
irregular periods. Regular periods um. know. get lot questions
PCOS, yeah, um you're. first person podcast that’s really
qualified talk PCOS real way um. talking many
androgens cysts ovary irregular ovarian. Excuse me. keep saying ovulatory
slash menstrual cycle um. indicators, recommend
women start taking Androgen blockers mean seems lot
PCOS there? hearing lot glad asked this, PCOS one
really poorly understood conditions gets kind flows flies radar
woman wants get pregnant got issue drives
physician, problem syndrome right, polycystic, ovary syndrome,
sometimes polycystic ovarian syndrome syndromes, don't necessarily fit together
really clear diagnostic criteria. instance, three different criteria
look for. ovaries um clinical manifestations
hyperandrogenism, hirsutism, acne things usually
irregular periods way that’s defined, least uh latest criteria,
period every 35 days less typical Cycle length, 28 35 days. know
skipping period there, criteria
use diagnose PCOS. four different systems literature
diagnosing PCOS, starts get confusing. women
gnosis ovaries, got hirsutism got irregular
periods. define haircitism here? Statism increased, hair growth, usually
places don't want women, can be, know, kind male pattern.
might notice breasts chest um course,
familial quality like. just looking paper last night, looking Israelis
much hair statism whether related CH E repeats
Androgen receptor. get um, not Israelis, um. women um, might
PCOS experience? Um androgenic alopecia, hair loss, that’s sort
quote-unquote male pattern, baldness. course it’s Androgen pattern baldness
opposed male talking testosterone, DHT related. Sometimes know
going invoke clinical experience rather seen
literature. Women definitely can androgenic alopecia. tend see later


life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

life, important point think PCOS. know, just
talking teenage years like wouldn't nice know
phenotype risk things people risk for, haven't
talked glucose Insulin. Yet know PCOS not just
problem terms irregular periods difficulty getting pregnant.
mostly problems 20s 30s early 40s, massive risk factor
cardiometabolic disease get older. many people tend pigeonhole. Pcos
problem reproductive age. thinking entire female life cycle
say it’s even important consider age 50. know
average age menopause 51-52 know elevated testosterone,
high androgens, probably greatest cardio metabolic driver disease
women PCOS wow. Now one thing want mention - still
notes - going talk microbiome testing that’s fun
subject taught saying much love people
taught medicine, taught
woman PCOS, make diagnosis. measure testosterone, see
acne blah blah. ask woman. One question: want get
pregnant not? women PCOS get started birth
control pill. don't want get pregnant, want get pregnant, help
get pregnant addressing PCOS issues like maybe give
Clomid something make ovulate frequently. way
conventional medicine approaches women gigantic disservice.
one things, speaking gender gap exists. feeling
research money goes women's health abysmal compared
goes mental health really - think that’s changing, also huge lack
awareness sex gender differences comes way construct
clinical trials experiments. Well, that’s absolutely true. mean sit on. sat
NIH review panels decade. Now regular standing member,
say see research it’s proposed. Yes, now it’s
required no Grant will get funded without sex biological variable,
way, folks, sex. Biological sex, noun, not sex. verb super
interesting, obviously, um say sex biological variable, meaning even
it’s study mice. start, though, didn't start long ago must
been. think can think don't want miss attribute here. think can thank Francis


Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

Collins insisting amen. Francis Bernadine Healy done much help us,
know made Women's Health Initiative, hope will get to,
hot mess like confusing. data came yeah trials
long, data now starting emerge. So, just clear mean
question don't think going take us off track. going pose
question hypothesis, think it’s likely little bit not
barbed wire question, maybe like prickly question people first hear it, it’s
posed hypothesis. mentioned psychosocial stress issues based
organizational level institutional level, societal level, maybe right
family just life biasing Health outcomes worse female
populations. Okay, refer patriarchy just trying put it, make sure
talking thing that’s non-exhaustive. realize that’s just
subset issues. also hearing lot PCOS, hyper
androgenization ovary talking mentioned. know,
excess testosterone females naturally testosterone
estrogen anyway, talking elevated levels. hypothesis, one
hypothesis, increased androgens pieceo PCOS
consequence psychosocial conditions are, don't say forcing biasing.
need females um think behave. React act certain ways survive, let alone
Thrive. don't say kind political correctness, hypothesis?
my. fun interesting think, important study run right depending
stress conditions. specific type stress females produce
produce androgens, neutral effect? make make sense? love
question, let just paraphrase last part make sure got it. sounds
like asking is: PCOS, least phenotypes PCOS
response calling patriarchy add second part it,
healthy? Women like production testosterone like? right? Yes,
acknowledgment mean you're, expert - um you're, physician,
clinician, expert hormones not, understanding absolute
levels hormones interesting perhaps not interesting ratios
testosterone estrogen. talking excess testosterone, really
not talking oh women, making lot testosterone frankly, already
make lot like people weren't aware that. wasn't aware women
make testosterone right, it’s not saying testosterone women bad


always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

always reaction environment. Yes, becomes um super
physiological hyper elevated is, imagine sorts social conditions
create males females, talking PCOS
females particular, love speculate um. run study,
totally run study don't know answer. suspect onto
something may not explain women PCOS because, mentioned,
lot different phenotypes, think explain significant portion -
know almost saying look gene environment Interface,
environmental influence someone got power you. If, PCOS
response that, way treat completely different. So,
one hand, want careful not dismiss suffering experience women
PCOS. got lot women PCOS family, much pain
suffering. know, especially want baby try years
just can't ovulate. hand, read paper recently, maybe
cite

01:22:57 PCOS, Insulin, Glucose Monitoring Management; Data Access

compares phenotype woman PCOS man hypoandrogenic,
think that’s really interesting way look this, thread haven't
talked PCOS role insulin glucose. So,
phenotypes PCOS, problem hyper insulin, emia High insulin blood
driving thika cells ovaries overproduce testosterone. women
insulin insensitive, insulin cranked out, cells ovary
therefore making Androgen. don't like say, insulin resistant, oh can uh.
don't problem saying: okay, just little bit outside lane lines
expertise, trying use it. correct nomenclature can
make sure? Well, like insulin, insensitive, way just said
think offers people way in, love terms messaging insulin.
Resistance starts lose people don't really get means.
receptor level, think say insulin insensitive, people hear insulin
sensitive, almost sounds like bad thing, that’s actually want. think
think that’s defaulted insulin. What’s insulin, don't know due


blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

blood test. Yes, due blood test um blood work done eight
months, um sure that'd great. uh always um experimenting different
supplements different behavioral regimens kept charts. Since 19., oh
you're, like patient, sort Obsessed say everybody
can afford time. Actually, save Insurance wouldn't cover it.
Um get basic blood work done, reference, soon possible,
even know talking women life cycle.
wish knew insulin teenager. wish wish. knew
fasting insulin was. really wish knew postprandial insulin like teenage years
20s 30s. Well, knew 30s starting 35.. fan continuous
glucose monitors, hugest gigantic fan cgms. never seen tool
ever used medicine change, Behavior way cgms wow.
think effective changing Behavior tried one, really liked it.
learned sauna insulin blood glucose goes up. Probably, bit
dehydration, learned kind foods work don't um. thought
fascinating. learned every Behavior possibly imagine, use
imagination, impacts, blood glucose, totally totally fascinating me, including
two-way wake-ups middle night versus one versus none impacted
blood glucose next morning fascinating data junkie. Like me, like
heaven um. think effective changing behavior?
people can see real-time control like scan like? Oh, that’s,
that’s sandwich. think it’s. think it’s many things. think it’s generally
enchantment learning chemistry biology. love think
seen know feel like. Doctors basically marketers like sacred
marketing, like job physician convince people something
think good them, based best science. can't just say here: wanted
fill prescription ctm. Market it. say. think
completely changes, way approach pre-diabetes. think
dramatically affect risk Alzheimer's disease worried
mother job Physicians sacred marketer. cgms one
tools think crucial. enchantment number two yeah. It’s real-time
effect, go get glucose Insulin, measured maybe like two
hour glucose challenge test look glucose Insulin fasting point,
one hour later, two hours later frequently, not kind


behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

behavior effect continuous data can say. Okay, drove see
Andrew place Berkeley stressful. torrentially raining,
know glucose elevated, like think, really understanding mediators
glucose control essential. Now said, it’s also kind later effect.
mean rather know insulin know uh white hat white Hall study
insulin, especially postprandial insulin, vascular, insulin, 2 can change years
years get change glucose, um that’s pre-diabetes
diabetes. think main reasons think it’s important tool.
Third thing: democratizes data too? mean incredible
podcast, think one hopeful exciting things seeing
right now health space. going patriarchal relationship
doctors hold power Gatekeepers data patients clients
much access enchantment chemistry
biology? exciting like able got. know,
probably 100 patients data stream looking
glucose - can mean sabbatical. not much anymore,
can call patient like. glucose high like? do? Oh
birthday. piece birthday cake like kind collaboration. also
teaching patient clinician me, loop benevolence
integrity think essential creating Health. got disease care system.
need democratization data become health-based system, Amen
million times over. share sentiment. can tell deep level. think
pandemic actually assisted well harm many things, assisted people's
understanding um no magic fairy government, anyone going
arrive door kit things make healthy right provide Sunlight
movement, sleep

01:29:48 Behaviors Vitality; Exercise & Body Phenotype; Cortisol

various aspects nutrition, no, nothing, nothing everyone access
first foremost, Implement things best can, speaking
kind circling back idea people late teens, 20s, 30s
onward. magic wand - give like two three don'ts make


personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

personal, go back time erase certain behaviors,
don'ts category be? Um, can tell us two three um, goal
maximize vitality Longevity not always uh parallel one another
right, they're, certainly not thing, sometimes orthogonal, but, just say,
fertility proxy Vitality Longevity, think people will sometimes forget -
fertility isn't just people want conceive children, it’s also it’s can
serve proxy vitality Longevity. like see patients
focus first female patients, um extends male patients well?
like see not yeah far less really like that. say
things just headline can go detail number one sleep. want
diverge little bit things, sleep probably not one them. Oh
well, feel free, mean you're. one worked 100. 120 hours week sleeping much
can't imagine unless, unless lived different reality do, um uh,
know - times career pulling all-nighters sleep
deprived, just it. don't recommend it, yeah. hope don't
anymore, no longer can avoid it, years many years like
right go quite um Adept one cycle yeah, two nights. kind
start fall fall apart totally yeah. say: sleep, alcohol, High perceived stress
love talk about, maybe um date telomeres know
like see people get enough sleep. don't don't just yeah! Not
concordant, um, not enough sleep much alcohol, much perceived, stress,
eating wrong Foods, toxic relationships isolation number six um not
moving enough not moving exercising way really fits body.
start one actually, just it’s work backwards, um uh,
that’s interesting. think nowadays people appreciate need quote unquote,
cardio. know exercise physiologists cringe dissolve puddle
Tears say that, getting heart rate period time longer
10 minutes order generate cardiovascular, health circulation resistance
training kind. Maybe flexibility, mean Body phenotype
exercise speak personal experience? mean gave
20s Medicine time occasionally got gym. know UCSF
Parnassus. go gym then, soon beeper went off
back hospital, didn't exercise much. um. remember
Nordic tracks? Nordic Track house like it.


believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

believe, because, me, primary outcome interested cardiometabolic
health, comes exercise really feel, going
population level, feel third cardio two-thirds resistance training based
Synthesis literature, best combination - and, think, know,
described sign um study, think, minimal, effective dose
population 150 minutes. think us need lot per week
per week, think know me, phenotype produces lot
insulin kind depending game, lot glucose.
exercise lot dispose glucose, think move
medicine population prescriptions population works
individual. think recommendation fantastic um, think resistance training. Well,
let put way: neither trainer physician, seen family
members doing, wouldn't say lot cardio, just cardio
add resistance, training, everything terms including biomarkers um
improved dramatically. Yes, particular female members family, well, one
one mediators think important, especially people call
chronic cardio, cortisol. know Runners, especially
marathon runners, people lot cardio don't much resistance training.
tend much High cortisol levels can buffer vitamin C,
vitamin C can decrease effect, chronic cardio doesn't always serve people.
quick personal example first started measuring hormone panels. went
physician said: 35. one kid. want another kid.
never exhausted. life. just feel like pushing rock hill. got
belly fat don't like um. don't want sex husband.
think? can offered birth control pill
antidepressant? Oh goodness, left went lab ran hormone
panel cortisol three times been. insulin
20s. fasting. glucose 105., thyroid mildly abnormal.
progesterone low, set course realizing
physician taking care, especially women, not getting root
causes essential, say start first Cortisol time
running four miles three times week four times week. just racing.
cortisol



01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

01:36:40 Cortisol Supplements: Ashwagandha, Rhodiola, Fish Oil, Phosphatidylserine

not right exercise me. needed adaptive exercise. started
Pilates yoga helped lower cortisol. mean started on.
know changing way managing perceived stress also changed
supplement. Richmond, can talk moment said, lowering
cortisol thought two supplements come mind um ashwagandha,
think can potently reduce cortisol. heard recommendations cycling.
always wondered time day. ashwagandha intake, sort
quote unquote want cortisol elevated early part day. Yes, know
uh, know not want cortisol peaking later day. No, not interferes
sleep, interferes sleep um supplement uh. Rhodiola
rosacea pronouncing correctly yeah. radiola effective. It’s
shown multiple randomized trials lower cortisol, effective.
sort doses started taking recently way, made huge mistake -
like make mistakes first, audiences don't make um.
taking it. heard adaptogen, thought oh I'll, take resistance
training. course want cortisol Peak resistance training,
that’s going set motion Adaptive response, start taking later day
it’s really improved. say late day. Second half day cognition.
subjective fair. just feel like even plane attention second
half day, describing NF1 experiment right, organic data.
Well, not anecdotal, taught Harvard Medical School hierarchy
evidence starts lowest expert opinion. know case studies,
got cohort studies got observational data, that’s prospective,
randomized trial, highest quality. Evidence end one experiment
serve control. describing rhodiola?
frame end one experiment, washout period
compare like measure metrics see.
effect, including cortisol, radial shown multiple randomized trials
reduce cortisol. thing think super effective phosphatidylserine PS
short fish oil also, modestly reduces cortisol. Ashwagandha interesting.
first book hormone cure, read way hoping
one read. did, read it’s spectacular thought going it. this,


like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

like know, just call was, it’s called male bias like. going
anything uh, I'm, don't ovaries know it’s gon na
immensely informative um. So, thank you, yeah. fun
Recollections walks took listening print version too.
like switch back forth. thank that. It’s it’s superb book
anyone read. Yeah yeah, appreciate chapter four, may may not
remember ashwagandha least time wrote book ashwagandha's
data not great, lack proof not proof against. ashwagandha.
data comes thousands years using ayurvedic medicine, it’s
considered not science hat. It’s considered double adaptogen it’s
potentially helpful high cortisol phenotype like like, sometimes still
low cortisol. haven't found patients, although give one
exception, ashwagandha mostly based animal studies. not much
human data, used ton Integrative Medicine. um one supplement
found incredibly helpful people tend high cortisol night
that’s called cortisol manager, it’s integrative Therapeutics. don't second
um supplement manufacturer makes something similar it’s number one selling
supplement, it’s effective. cocktail several things? It’s combination
phosphatidylserine ashwagandha. tell phosphatidylserine.
familiar it’s mentioned guests Tim Ferriss
podcast long ago. reasons, think related sleep, yes, um maybe that’s
another reason like um, move rhodiola,
dosage rhodiola rosacea um? refer people book
randomized trials doses used there. can't remember
rhodiola, although took morning prepare yeah. can look
put show, note caption, can remember dose phosphatidyl serum,
take regularly 400 800 milligrams typical dose PS
What’s interesting randomized trials done, 400 Milligrams
effective 800 milligrams. Interesting. found several supplements
lower dose effective. Yes, um yeah, won't doesn't matter
were, so, say PS, referring way folks not PCOS,
just scientists clinicians familiar Military familiar
acronyms uh, phosphatidylserion PSO 400 800 milligrams, 400. effective
taken later day early day, matter depends cortisol


high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

high, tend know: What’s pattern cortisol? Typically, rises
peak 30 60 minutes get up, gradual kind asymptotic
decline go bed. you're, someone like Peaks like way crazy high
- don't anymore, that’s used do. needed phosphatidylserine
morning.

01:42:36 Cortisol, Anxiety & Immune System; Adrenal Function, Resilience

people high night, What’s known flat cortisol pattern
inverted pattern, want take night flat pattern. Just quick sidebar
that’s associated number conditions mainstream Physicians don't
know about. flat pattern it’s low morning it’s high night
associated anxiety, depression, uh decreased survival breast cancer
studied Stanford David Spiegel. That’s um collab close, even
collaborator, even uh breath. Work study oh interesting, yeah
associate chair Psychiatry now, wonderful human amazed
guest podcast now fantasizing conversation includes uh
panel uh, Incredible Minds like David clinical side,
case um yeah, late shifted, cortisol, not good, not good, seems
worst immune, Downstream issues cortisol patterns. that’s really
important know maps things like um, it’s related PTSD.
that’s pattern see like vets. Who'Ve got PTSD well others. maps
autoimmunity maps fibromyalgia. told 1 12 people um
heterozygous, one mutant copy hypomorphic mutation adrenal
related genes, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, true so, means 1
12 people walking around cranking Far much cortisol not enough
cortisol cortisol system already skewed direction makes life
challenging levels talking um. hear correctly, 1
12 not small number? It’s not small number, fits see clinically
mean want see data just see um. mean
modulate environmental influences, certainly fits see know.
taught mainstream medicine that, terms adrenal function, it’s
binary clinicians think it. either Addison's disease
don't make enough cortisol got cushions Cushing weed pattern


make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

make much cortisol anything middle normal, experience
hell no like are. us like make lot cortisol - don't
cushions. Maybe got one these. wouldn't call mutant Gene. call
vulnerable Gene, maybe one those. Maybe that’s part
reason make know two three times be, aware certain
groups individuals within military sector um frequent
occurrence mutation CCH, congenital adrenal, hyper prevention, not
Necessarily two copies, will, people look going go. Oh wow,
phenotypes um sort hypomorphic type thing. know
less much cortisol good staying multiple days per
night. Right, multiple nights series, can pull all-nighters easily yeah.
can push harder people quit everyone thinks well, that’s
great phenotype have, guess it’s, hyper produce cortisol, yeah
um. that’s interesting think panel medical students
graduate students - look - know - pulling excessively long
hours, stressed lot even outside Academia medicine pushing
pushing pushing really hard. think ability push not crash, think
adaptive, sense it’s maladaptive series years sort
described earlier yeah. It’s good point, know ways
want select certain professions like military like medicine um,
wonder folks downstream consequences producing
much cortisol. Oh, it’s got detrimental health, it’s got long run
- see that, even data shows someone like me,
makes lot cortisol higher rates depression like 50 people major Depression
high cortisol levels, higher rates suicide, um much metabolic dysfunction.
know trauma example maps increased risk glucose metabolism
issues certainly High cortisol. it’s one jobs cortisol
manage glucose it’s kind sets um one number five,
toxic relationships. know someone hyper produces cortisol it’s hard live
someone like that. It’s also, say, people um: just call
biological resilience, it’s not always adaptive, can stay bad
circumstances, longer ability crash provided it’s not suicide life life destroying
know, long Arc



01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

01:48:07 Tool: Omega-3 Fatty Acids, Inflammation, Specialized Pro-Resolving Mediators

pause requirement know take two years off work school
something um. ability keep pressing double-edged sword. put
way. Um, want make sure staying within conversation uh,
mentioned Foster dial serine. talked rhodiola rosacea, talked bit
ashwagandha. also talked Omega-3s fish oil, particular. love
know favorite sources these. think nowadays, General acceptance
getting essential fatty acids important. threshold level sort
grams? encouraged uh um podcast listeners consider, depending
eating, try get gram EPA per day. seem excessive
real data epa's, cardiovascular experts always hit
back say? Oh, no, know it’s not good cardiovascular health go.
Oh it’s better antidepressants studies go no. feel like
really want make life difficult. want raise cortisol, go Twitter
say something positive Omega-3s fish oil um, learn lot
um. thoughts Omega-3s? take lot them. always big
fan yeah. personalize, think people need others,
measure level, gets back nutritional testing. you,
suggest Omega Quant one favorite cardiometabolic panels
Cleveland heart lab. think give reliable information, not just
lipids subclasses, know NMR fractionation, also gives
insulin resistance score. gives um levels Omega-3s great, we'll, provide links
different sites, people, one quick thing that. whole story
not Omega-3s taking fish oil. work Charlie Sirhan Brigham
showing way resolve inflammation, understanding it, really,
think, learning crawl stage. so, look omega-3 6 pathway
body, fish oils can help. know kind push reactions particular direction,
typically not enough resolution inflammation. Now people do,
including MBA players? pop ibuprofen something like
got inflammation, that’s got lots side effects not good you,
know terms resolution inflammation, taking something like ibuprofen
reduces amplitude inflammation 50 percent, potentially blocks
complete resolution inflammation. new supplements may


heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people
don't need that, know supplements don't know need


01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know

going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.

heard called specialized, pro-resolving mediators lot different
supplement companies make combined fish oil seems
best combination athletes. Who'Ve got. know kind normal
aches pains training load. combine little aspirin small dose
just like 81 milligrams two baby aspirin together fish oil plus specialized
pro-resolving mediators NSF certified. sports,
dose, say patients, need thousand
milligrams. Gram mentioned population, need six
grams together spms, think personalized young um it? Okay
people start taking Omega-3s, instance young women teens people
20s 30s young guys 20s 30s, take fish oil just
assuming they're, not going get anything tested. thinking college
student really biomarkers sort thing go, um,
many people won't, want right thing. try drink little
less. Hopefully, hopefully won't smoke vape, please don't smoke vape idea
vaping okay. It’s like had. bad, bad everything. talking
about. end that, it’s like exactly just know avoid hopefully try
avoid things. Hopefully, avoid hard drugs um, hopefully avoid getting
STIs resolve quickly. Hopefully yes um so, might say:
oh well, okay, willing know, take magnesium take phosphodel
serine buffer. cortisol eat vegetables um. consider taking fish oil
kind across-the-board inoculatory thing, put rank order these, say,
fish oil. Yes, think thousand milligrams general recommendation good,
also food first philosophy, preference salmon
kind Smash fish getting primary source
Omega-3s. days don't fish, recommend probably twice
week take fish oil. put magnesium next since many people
deficient, probably put vitamin D many IU vitamin D per day? Well,
keep asking like population yeah well the. Let put
way laze, lazy person - not person
um just doesn't finances go. Get measured, yeah levels measured
know audience huge range. got people can tons
disposable income list spot. people no disposable income,
thousand two thousand international units. know dose


serum level, that’s 50 90. great, vitamin D receptor,
uh snip, need take 5 000 day get need Lot people

01:54:20 Oral Contraceptives, Benefits & Risks; Ovarian Cancer; Testosterone

Mentioned phosphatidylserine someone college student cortisol
completely normal. wasting money PS. don't need it, might
need later, don't need now. like make sure Circle back birth
control, particular oral contraceptive birth control, touch iuds,
perhaps little bit more. thoughts sort pure estrogen, birth
control? learned college birth control basically
tonic, estrogen, constantly taking estrogen estrogen women taking estrogen
don't get estrogen priming progesterone you're, not getting ovulation,
known women Taking oral Contra took oral contraception
like estrogen pills, basically 5, 10 15 years. long-term consequences
this, relates pregnancy, PCOS menopause? What? so,
consequences? Um? concerns? like oral
contraceptives? dislike them? like balanced ask
question. women take oral contraceptives long describing like 10
years longer, call Olympic oral contraceptive users terms benefit. think
that, especially first came out, even now gives women reproductive
choice That’s essential. may know, reproductive Choice
declining recently. big fan regard got lot data show
risks also benefits it. speak first benefits uh gon
na get soapbox little bit risks. know reduces risk
ovarian cancer. something idea incessant ovulation. not
good female body. look at, instance, women nuns don't
take oral contraceptives period every single month reproductive
lives, greater risk brain cancer. look, women
uh several babies got period time pregnant not
ovulating, breastfeed period time. lower risk
ovarian cancer, oral contraceptives help reducing ovulation reducing risk.


know take oral contraceptive five years, reduces risk
ovarian cancer 50 that’s significant poor diagnosing
ovarian cancer early really no method, that’s really effective. use ca125
ultrasound screen, especially women, greater genetic risk, even
often diagnose it. know later stage, maybe just statement
going highlight number people. question
earliest symptoms people can recognize without blood test ovarian cancer.
going pain, problem symptoms vague they're, non-
specific one common symptoms bloating already talked
constipation talked women longer track, GI tract
bloating Really common experience women, can bulk symptoms.
know feeling like your. lower belly kind pressed out, way
inform women terms watching get regular, gynecologic exams
women high risk, have, instance, ultrasound.
reason. shows mass concerned way triage terms
kind evaluation need that’s situation might get
blood test called ca129 CA 125., um yeah. problem symptoms.
vague be, depends big tumor is, much bulk have, it’s
pressing so, um taking estrogen thereby reducing frequency ovulation,
lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend

lowers risk ovarian cancer. women even women not
sexually active, not actively trying get pregnant avoid getting
pregnant, not sexually active, probability conceiving unless
go IUI route is, low. far know um,
taught high school anyway um wise suppress ovulation
periodically using hormone-based contraception just can offset risk
ovarian cancer? That’s rational question say that’s mainstream
medicine back recommend oral contraceptives, not just women
seeking contraception, acne painful periods really kind drop
hat prescribing oral contraceptives. That’s taught do,
many consequences think issue consent, OB
GYN started board-certified, ob gyn now mostly see men.
taught OB GYN convince women go oral contraceptive think
lot pharmaceutical influence. maybe talk risks
answer no question. Um that. just ask: um so-


called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.

called ring new used called nuva Ring? Maybe that’s brand name,
college discussion ring right men
women reasons don't belong podcast um use imagination folks,
um ring. Obviously it’s not oral. It’s not oral hormone contraception, it’s
hormone based right. rate releasing estrogen locally opposed taking orally.
slot tell us terms
concerns, less data ring. oral contraceptive two
hormones, it’s ethanyl estradiol it’s progestin. it’s not normal uh
progesterone body makes ovaries make adrenals make.
synthetic form progesterone progestin similar class.
shown dangerous provocative women's health initiative. not fan
progestins. not recommend woman unless consequence not
taking surgery um. know unless gives freedom.
way, don't like Protestants, uh nuva ring estrogen plus progestin,
it’s released transdermally vagina. So, given way um it’s
delivered vagina, doses lower What’s taken orally, terms
risks talk about, don't know much data.
think it’s similar, there's, probably spectrum risk maneuvering, little
towards middle know. talking oral
contraceptives? ready yeah, ready risks? Okay, like
almost pharmaceutical. oral contraceptive depletes certain micronutrients,
magnesium certain vitamin B's depleted uh. also affects
microbiome data not strong, seems effect
also increased risk inflammatory bowel disease autoimmune condition.
increases inflammatory tone, studies seen increase one markers
inflammatory tone, High sensitivity CRP two three x. seems make
hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis rigid can't kind roll
punches Wax Wane terms cortisol production. way can off
birth control pill can affect thyroid function. thinking slide
like 10 problems associated oral contraceptive, that’s can remember
right now, that’s helpful makes wonder whether not if, one hand,
oral contraceptives protective women. It’s ovarian cancer,
issues. Yeah, one want mention. Please anytime, take
oral estrogen. raises sex hormone Nick globulin talked podcast


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,

hard blends supplements, it’s straightforward single
ingredient formulations, also momentous supplements ship internationally,
important realize many reside outside United States.
like see supplements discussed Huberman Lab podcast, can go
live, momentous, spelled ous, that’s livemomentis.com Huberman. Thank
joining Today’s discussion. female hormone Health, vitality
Longevity Dr Sarah Gottfried last, certainly not least, thank
interest science. [Music]


guests Kyle. think sex hormone, binding globulin. think sponge
soaks free, estrogen free testosterone. go birth control bill,
raise sex hormone, binding globulin. soaks especially free testosterone
women it’s not big deal. don't notice. Much difference,
phenotype, maybe related CAG, repeats Androgen receptor,
exquisitely sensitive decline free testosterone. opens portal
talking little bit testosterone women. mentioned already it’s
abundant, biologically abundant hormone female system, even
though men make almost 10 times much even 10 times,
important women. essential many things. Not just sex drive muscle
mass seeing response resistance training, also confidence agency,
women sensitive testosterone level. got high
sex hormone, binding globulin, testosterone declines. describe vaginal
dryness. Maybe decline sex drive, also bigger issue related
confidence agency, even risk-taking studies done MBA students.
That, think, serious problem. Maybe important things
can shrink clitoris 20 percent twenty percent, includes
regression nerves innervate clitoris mean that’s
good question. neuroscientist yeah, think uh used teach uh neural
side reproductive Health. need series Sexual Health. Maybe
co-host me. certainly use expertise. think um yeah,
that’s dramatic! That’s interesting number yeah, go back sacred
marketing. got woman think not birth control pill, maybe
taking acne taking it, periods little painful.
going say: leverage ways making period less painful.
take message painful periods figure out. Okay, it’s
inflammatory tone give fish oil spms, maybe little aspirin
got period like, find ways deal it, then, take
oral contraceptive not received informed consent about, Can
trick 20 now usually convinces people come reversible?
elevation sex hormone, binding globulin, not seem go away come
off birth control pill. me, biggest problem prescribing oral
contraceptives. Now data limited, one woman uh
Claudia, something something looked sex hormone, binding globulin year


stopping birth control pill, still elevated. wasn't high
pill, still elevated. question reversibility -
don't know know answer that.

02:06:50 Fertility, Follicular & Anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) Assessments

Wow, okay, um, that’s yeah! That’s significant statement something
consideration related this, although might seem not related early
recommend women go get follicle number assessed, words, get
size, sense size ovarian reserve amh levels measured um,
gon na amateur Outsider, say this, episode fertility
just described ovulatory menstrual cycle, yeah um not best
person answer yeah. Well, far it: okay, well, um! suppose, then,
taking perspective somebody thinks fertility terms least
congruent vitality Longevity, given it’s fairly non-invasive, it’s ultrasound
blood draw amh both. reason woman not want get
follicle number assessed amh levels assessed? reason why?
shocked learn women don't they're, hitting
late 30s early 40s yeah conceived suddenly decide
want conceive - thought doesn't every doctor insist female
patients get amh level addressed need freeze eggs cost it’s
cost yeah. think got disposable income it, go it. It’s not
included standard blood panel, no wow, women practice, who've
amhs done looked follicle count women want freeze
eggs or, requires disposable income um trouble getting
pregnant. reproductive Endocrinology system getting
evaluation also um women symptoms early
menopause, premature, ovarian insufficiency, age 40. uh.
women see getting attested think right offered
broadly. speaks democratization data think women
don't know huge service. think speaking one
point related see conventional medicine woman
asks hormone panel not trying get pregnant, usually gets told
hormones vary much. It’s waste money, don't need or, feeling


hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain

top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine

middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,

hormonal, don't go birth control pill unless trying get pregnant
trying get pregnant? Suddenly tests reliable get
know testosterone, free testosterone, thyroid panel. get
estrogen progesterone. Maybe get cortisol, get amh.
double standard want get pregnant don't
needs end. totally agree learned um ovulatory cycle
amh antral population follicles it. It’s fascinating. just seems
wow relatively straightforward test. One definitely invasive ultrasound, don't
consider yeah, that’s not not terribly invasive, invasive uh, least
one. Just pure blood.

02:10:29 Menopause & Hormone Replacement Therapy; Women’s Health Initiative

Test just seems like why, wouldn't wouldn't offered covered insurance
know anyone wanted, now now understand mentioned
menopause huge topic, enormous topic. guest podcast who's, not
clinician said something passing, wan na likely get wrong um.
said results large-scale trials hormone replacement
therapy women menopause said something effect of. hormone
therapy started early enough, beneficial yes, vitality health
outcomes, whereas women went menopause initiated hormone
therapy hormone replacement therapy detrimental health. So, first
all, recall statement correctly then, second all, sorts hormones
replaced? just estrogen, done? done birth
control, oral contraceptives nuvarings? thoughts menopause?
people start thinking palette things available
can entire episode topic future? just
know, get lot questions guessing based everything.
told today women 30s that, may 20 years
menopause, probably things now. anticipation yes,
haven't talked 30, something, totally agree you,
know phenotype, hormonal phenotype, 30s
set terms future, especially things like thyroid,
estrogen progesterone levels, can replace state Youth thyroid


whatever you, can replace. don't usually go exactly back
estrogen progesterone levels were, can get pretty close. 30s,
base case, think really essential. spoke Women's Health
Initiative, published 2002, went huge number women
taking hormone therapy small percentage like range five percent,
means got millions. Millions women suffering needlessly
things like insomnia difficulty mood difficulty sex drive, feeling like
closing store terms sex not hormone therapy. agree
statement made hormone therapy particular forms similar
body always made it’s given judiciously right time, typically
within five ten years menopause, 51 52, incredibly safe. it’s
complicated study, women's health initiative, wrong study
wrong patients wrong medications um wrong outcomes.
powered look cardiovascular outcomes. not powered look
breast cancer. stopped breast cancer risk, happened
control arm study incredibly low rate breast cancer so,
result, ended increased risk breast cancer five years
Stopped study now study done synthetics. done
conjugated equine estrogen known Premarin medroxy progesterone acetate.
so-called estrogen progesterone. synthetic hormones.
think, especially progestin associated greater risk breast cancer.
Although subsequent re-evaluations data now 18 years out, shown
um problem control group no increased risk breast cancer um
women got estrogen hysterectomy, Premarin,
actually Decreased breast cancer risk decreased breast cancer mortality.
lot said this: trying keep really brief. look
women 50 60, within 10 years menopause they're, ones seem
greatest benefit, decreased subclinical, atherosclerosis, less
cardiovascular disease. improvement terms bone health, um, less
progression diabetes age 60. started greater risk
certain outcomes cardiovascular disease, myocardial,

02:15:30 Perimenopause, Cerebral Hypometabolism, Metabolism & Estrogen



Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need

Infarction on, asked um. me, problem not
just menopause. What’s interesting talk perimenopause,
perimenopause period time final menstrual cycle
women depending it’s tuned, symptoms. can last 10 years,
still Period menopause. It’s like 20 years, tracking
carefully. usually gets kicked off cycle get closer together.
happen 30s 40s. go 28 days 25 days. sort thing
may notice start sleeping poorly, progesterone important.
talked Kyle. may notice anxiety. Difficulty sleeping,
probably related estrogen receptor. Alpha estrogen receptor.
Alpha anxio, increases anxiety, ER beta associated anxiolytic activity
total six estrogen receptors. Now g-protein-
coupled estrogen receptors mixed: anxiolytic anxiogenic, um,
whole period perimenopause What’s Fascinating me, got
talk either today another time massive massive
change happens female brain people not talking enough
looking work Lisa Moscone Cornell uh starting around age 40.,
massive change cerebral metabolism, can fdg pet scans. can
look glucose uptake average, 20 decline pre-menopause.
know like age 35 perimenopause, post menopause women
symptoms perimenopause menopause, Hot Flashes, night
sweats, difficulty sleeping ones significant
cerebral hypomatabolism. it’s almost like um. don't. don't want scare people
language, it’s low level call pseudo dementia sorts. Yes it.
seems phenotype can map Alzheimer's disease, that’s
Lisa moscone's work she's, looking okay, Alzheimer's disease not disease old
age, disease middle age. biomarkers can Define?
can tell risk is. got mother grandmother Alzheimer's
disease. can believe data insulin resistance. It’s huge part
sensitivity, talked um seems somewhere there, think
first, idea first surfaced people like really, course
right mean brain just incredibly metabolically demanding organ. deprive
neurons fuel sources, make less sensitive fuel sources. start
dying, certainly start firing less. makes perfect sense, think now it’s thanks


Lisa's work, work done talked about. Quite lot um
books elsewhere. think really know, highlighted people metabolism
metabolomics going important genes genomics comes
that’s right, dementia, perhaps especially women, safe say think think
so, believe System regulated estrogen, decline
estrogen starting around age 40, 43 kind average seems driver behind
cerebral hypomatabolism. way describe patients it’s like slow brain
energy, walk room. can't remember why, like just notice
can't manage tasks, way like things just little slower,
say women like like help circling
back Whi, women scared death taking hormone therapy,
got women Marching toward potentially greater risk Alzheimer's
disease. opportunity 40s 50s take hormone
therapy. may not offered it, typical conventional approach
based Whi say, unless hot flashes night sweats
severe. not going give hormone therapy, just want call out.
say: no not way approach further. concept right now
conventional medicine hot flashes night sweats nuisance
symptoms will take care temporarily, maybe little bit estrogen,
progesterone birth control. Pill it’s given lot pass
idea, know suck suck up, doesn't matter you're, not sleeping anymore.
know turn temperature room that’s not right, hot
flashes night sweats biomarker cardiometabolic disease.
biomarker increased bone loss. biomarker changes brain.
many symptoms occur perimenopause not driven ovaries.
driven brain yeah. It’s bi-directional crosstalk body
brain keeps know, think, resounding theme: uh. Chris
Palmer here. psychiatrist talking ketogenic, diet, mental health. know
uh you, whole discussion will. hope agree
nutrition relates hormones, uh, specific diets forth,
that’s question whether problem cerebral hyper metabolism.
solve estrogen

02:21:49 Intermittent Fasting, Ketogenic Diet, Metabolic Flexibility



increased metabolic flexibility, just wanted footnote sorry interrupt
you. No please uh, please interrupt um uh. know Europe long there. know
fan instances intermittent fasting time, restricted, feeding
ketogenic diet. Yes, um get cells sensitive insulin, not say,
understand correctly, not say women need stay ketogenic diet
long periods time intermittent fast. time, restricted, feeding eight
hours six hours day, increasing said metabolic flexibility, excuse me,
increasing cells, sensitivity insulin maybe returning typical
eating pattern periodically switching back forth. might actually benefit
beneficial. right, yeah? love pulse, feel like it’s much
physiologic say going ketogenic diet staying years. data
ketogenic diet. It’s pretty Limited terms duration. know
longest players terms data focus epilepsy
that’s just different phenotype. think terms microbiome effects - diversity
dysbiosis issues. really don't know terms long-term effects,
prefer, ketogenic diet it’s used NF1 experiment four
weeks. Maybe measure biomarkers afterwards. Maybe look stool
afterwards still haven't talked stool tests yet, measure
fasting insulin glucose

02:23:29 Stool Testing

just start four weeks Keto clean keto, including vegetables,
doesn't 57 day measure afterwards, since mentioned
mentioned stool testing. Yes, what? recommendation stool testing?
recommendation? field disposable
income, usually start Genova, got good copay system
insurance. That’s typically use, usually one day, stool test,
go digging stool send off slab. That’s North Carolina.
usually one day unless concerned parasites. case, tend
three days. people travel fair amount go places
greater risk - just gut symptoms. Another test lot um,
always like mention two Labs test longevity, much data


wonk uh type test, it’s powered AI. designed um guy got
inflammatory bowel disease um PhD deep, phenotyping bioinformatics
guy wanted make really easy. test is, Umbrella thorn
um. just call got bio. might another name just
improved it’s just wipe instead digging stool,
athletes will now not digging stool before. anybody
really? No one is, don't want answer. know answer. prefer that, that’s
super interesting test, it’s get much dense data. issue um,
apologies friends Thorne. issue recommendations. End
sworn

02:25:32 Coronary Artery Calcium (CAC) Test, ACE Score & Disease

Supplements can easy people want know, connect
dots. That’s not always way like uh. First all, three things: um
shared us, immense amount knowledge, first statement also want
apologize, threw entire life span uh female lifespan,
reproductive Health, contraception, diet, uh, microbiome, many things um. first
just want say taught tremendous amount um, including, think something
people, including myself, not thought enough,
psychosocial impact things familiar constipation bowel movements,
eat, avoid. say really huge thank that, it’s
not something that’s discussed podcast sort know brain
communicates body psychology biology linked. think first
time anyone's ever directly linked circumstances biology psychology
concrete way. that’s that’s first thing speak many people that.
Second all, barely scratched surface knowledge um,
uh frustrating uh it. always want learn more, know many
people well, also very, exciting, uh uh, hopefully without
much persuasion, can back talk something all. Like meant
uh, know working men. Now Men's Health um particulars around,
think, us explore terms PCOS, menopause, contraception
above, something talking off camera um
started, think really important Factor ties back issue


trauma stress bi-directional relationship biology psychology,
hopefully someday. won't even separate two use specific
medicines, including plant medicines, yes, can influence overall health,
no doubt will include Hormone Health. say two reasons. First
all, queue won't even call part two, sequel um.
gratified hear join us also just really extend
huge. Thank you. amount knowledge shared immense uh
going very, useful actionable men terms thinking
actions, women particular. Today’s discussion, particular women
terms think health biology, think psychology
environment that’s embedded just want say enormous.
Thank you. Thank Andrew. appreciate that, appreciate offer
world terms weigh-in way understand physiology how, craft
architect better life um. Can just add one last thing, didn't talk since
didn't get 40s 50s listed biomarkers. feel like people,
women went away one thing today, coronary artery, calcium
score age 45 sooner got premature heart disease. taken?
it’s CT scan chest. can self-order like, think, Stanford Hospital
can self-order last time patient checked. 250, disposable income,
tells it. almost gives fork road terms much need
pay attention cardiometabolic health woman it’s uh 45 men too.
haven't one, one, no, need one insulin, cortisol CAC great. run
you. It’s really essential it’s um yeah. It’s it’s fascinating
know women zero. score zero that’s great
often can just keep doing, 45 starting
elevated got know, maybe got PCOS got
biomarkers tending direction. Toward number one killer, really it’s nine
top 10 killers US allows really start make changes,
think it’s essential know data. It’s not it’s, probably not going offered
doctor. Certainly Peter attia going offer it, conventional doctors not
going last thing want say mention. go
doctor - just say want cardiac calcium score - that’s people coronary
artery, calcium, scores, CAC! Okay, everyone hear know that, 40
older - maybe you're, 45, 45 older get get last thing -


men women - score adverse childhood experiences? Knowing
score essential terms baseline, much trauma system, Pine
system, endured kid, know childhood trauma, whether it’s
abuse neglect, know, alcoholic parent maps disease
middle age - can give much Insight give example: got
patient elevated, coronary, artery, calcium score, everything right
food? think trauma elevated CAC 45..
think score knowing score, starting teenager like knowing
knowing work really essential. certain people,
exceedingly rare, one person speak, knowledge just
comes comes it’s incredibly useful helpful knowledge.
thank you. gon na get things. Good um highly recommend
everyone else pursue ways can get can't get they.
know Mark, things get point can obtain
