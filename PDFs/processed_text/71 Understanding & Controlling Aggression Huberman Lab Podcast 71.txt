Again, interested, can go helixsleep.com/huberman $200 off
two free pillows. talk aggression. think many people put
off aggression, although others drawn aggression
observing others. reason talk aggression is, mentioned
before, context aggression really matters. instances
aggression adaptive. instance, mother protecting children
attacked, children threatened. think people agree
so-called maternal aggression sort, provided context right, great thing.
Protecting young one primary adaptive drives species,
thank goodness is. course, forms aggression like unprovoked, proactive
aggression, somebody simply violent somebody else, even unprovoked,
us cringe see kind behavior, can even evoke aggression
people observe kind behavior. again, context really matters,
general perhaps even important reason think
understand aggression understanding biology psychology
aggression, will much better position understand emotional states
come be, others. instance, many probably
heard statement believe arises pop psychology, not formal academic
psychology, aggression just sadness. form sadness amplified
shows aggression. look underlying biology peer
reviewed literature this, nothing truth. distinct


circuits brain aggression versus grief mourning, non-overlapping.
Now doesn't mean can't sad aggressive state mourning
aggressive time, idea sadness aggression one
thing simply not true. understanding that, perhaps
understanding irritability aggression not thing, much
better position apply tools will talk episode order
able reduce eliminate, adaptive modulate aggression. yes,
cases modulating aggression cases, even amplifying
aggression can adaptive. Now course not first discussion
biology aggression psychology aggression. really can look
beginning last century time formal study aggression really
began. One names associated formal study aggression
none Konrad Lorenz. may familiar name, others
may not familiar name. Konrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting
behaviors fixed action pattern behaviors. famous, least scientific
circles, getting geese believe parent. put
Google Conrad K, Lorenz, just sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese, going
see lot photos Conrad walking roads lot geese following
swimming lakes lot geese following him. habit geese adopting
behaviors partook in. swim lake front
bunch little geese think parent
imprint him. even lived animals lived him, sort
strange character hear. nonetheless, work deserving
Nobel prize discovered fixed action patterns. patterns
behavior evoked single stimulus. Okay. really important.
idea can get whole category behaviors, like swimming behind parent,
looking somebody comfort, them, idea get huge
category different behaviors bunch different contexts triggered just
presence person remarkable, suggested turns
true neural circuits, not just individual brain areas, collections
brain areas work together engage pattern behaviors. first
fundamental principle need define today, talk aggression,
talking activation neural circuits, not individual brain areas, neural
circuits get played sequence like keys piano, playing


sequence means aggression verb. beginning, middle end,
process. not event. see, turns important
terms thinking one can halt aggression, prevent happening
initiated, maybe even prolonging aggression, needed. Now, Konrad
Lorenz no real knowledge neural circuits. mean, obviously knew
thing call brain nervous system, knew
chemicals brain hormones things sort likely play
role, really didn't take measures define neural circuits were,
frankly, didn't need to. Nobel prize beautiful work.
known abundance work, think sorts underlying
processes drive something like aggression. talked one particular
feature especially important, notion pressure. idea yes,
certain hormones will bias somebody animal aggressive, certain neural
transmitter states, learn today will bias somebody
less aggressive, maybe even submissive passive, maybe outright proactively
aggressive towards anyone anything front them. yes, course will
historical features based childhood, et cetera, et cetera. understood
will constellation things drive people aggressive.
described so-called pressure, almost like hydraulic pressure. Just think fluid
pressure small container pushed, pushed, pushed can,
container ready explode multiple features, multiple variables impinge
create pressure. turns exactly way system works.
no single brain area flips switch aggression. Although soon talk
brain structure generally houses propensity output
aggression. notion hydraulic pressure can drive us toward aggressive
behavior conversely can low pressure keep us state non-reactivity,
maybe even passivity submissiveness important feature really
captures essence neural circuits work talking primitive
behaviors generally. can start notice others, can
start notice veering toward aggression someone veering
toward aggression, verbal physical. Now veering buildup hydraulic
pressure

00:15:50 Brain Regions Controlling Aggression, Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH)



Lorenz referring to, really underlying biological basis. Now
years later first experiments came along, really started
identify brain areas biological so-called pressures can induce
aggressive behavior. person really gets credit guy name
Walter Hess, time working cats. know say working
cats, lot people will cringe. lot people cats pets, certainly cats
can delightful. people like more, people like less. people
cringe idea experiments cats. say days,
laboratories work cats. laboratories work animal models will work
flies, Drosophila fruit flies capacity genetics, laboratory mice,
sometimes rats, usually mice. occasionally find lab still works
cats. Back time Hess, laboratories worked mice, laboratories
worked cats rats. reason nowadays laboratories use mice
use animal models genetic tools exist mice knock
gene knock gene, et cetera, can't done humans non-human
primates, least not easily point history. say working
cats, realized probably evokes negative emotions you, maybe
even aggression you, can do, however, look data make
use data terms understanding. Hess cats
awake able lower stimulating electrode brain. Now keep
mind brain not pain sensors. small hole made
skull, electrodes lowered brain. done commonly human
neurosurgery. able stimulate different brain areas sort
poking around. say sort of, logical intent
purpose, wasn't just poking around fun. trying identify brain
regions generate entire categories behavior, ALA Lorenz, right?
fixed action pattern behaviors. Eventually electrode landed site provided
electrical stimulation cat caused otherwise passive purring relaxing cat
suddenly go absolute rage. arched back, hissing hair up. called
piloerection, hairs go up, animals try make big possible
often aggressive. Drooling, maybe even spitting, believe not, cats
animals can this. cat tried attack anyone else, anything
else, even inanimate objects stimulated particula brain area. Hess


obviously took notice incredible transformation behavior. fact
turned off stimulation particular brain area, cat quickly within
seconds, went back passive calm kitty. Now, course, repeated
experiment animals confirm wasn't just happenstance,
wasn't something unique one cat perhaps stimulated
area built kittenhood cat reactivated.
Maybe kitten traumatized early life scared reactivation
particular circuit, unique cat created aggressive behavior. wasn't
case, every cat looked stimulated particular brain area, cat
immediately go aggressive, almost rage type behavior. Now, course can't
anthropomorphize. don't know cat feeling. know cat
happy, although seems pretty unlikely later experiments done mice,
also humans confirm indeed, stimulation brain area evoked not just
behavioral aggression, also subjective feelings aggression anger.
incredible brain area, rather, say, brain area
harbored incredible capacity generate aggressive behavior Hess's
experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural
circuits, oftentimes center back amygdala prefrontal cortex,
names will come up. haven't heard before, don't worry,
make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000
neurons so, not exactly 3000, 3000 neurons sufficient generate
aggressive behavior sort Hess observed cat, believe not,
see somebody act rage act verbal aggression act
defensive aggression, protecting family loved ones country, et cetera,
almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments
done just recently within last 10 years so, leading right year
even last month keep confirming again,


activity neurons ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,
ventromedial hypothalamus mouse, pretty straightforward
sort known started experiments. analyzed
genes, meaning DNA, course becomes RNA RNA becomes protein,
DNA therefore proteins expressed particular cells
ventromedial hypothalamus. turns particular category neurons
ventromedial hypothalamus make estrogen receptor.
neurons particular responsible generating aggressive behavior.
know this? Well, used tool actually described previous guest
podcast. episode psychiatrist bioengineer
colleague Stanford School Medicine, Karl Deisseroth, others
developed tools allow people control activity neurons essentially remote
control, shining light neurons. context experiment
mouse, David's lab did, beautiful experiments Dayu
Lin now laboratory New York University, put little fiber optic cable
brain hypothalamus mouse. mouse able
move around cage freely moving, even though little tether, little wire,
thin wire. little thin wire actually little call optrode.
experimentalist case, Dayu, able stimulate turning little bit
blue light blue light activated estrogen receptor neurons
ventromedial hypothalamus way able that, introduced
gene developed friend, Karl Deisseroth allows light trigger
electrical activity neurons. confusing,
confusing, experiment. mouse cage. little wire coming
head. doesn't notice, believe not. know 'cause still eating
mating things mics like daily basis sleeping, et
cetera. mere pressing button will activate little bit light released
end wire, light activates particular neurons case, estrogen
receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus. mouse
cage another mouse, couple things happen depending
mouse is, say mouse is. male mouse put
female mouse, male mouse will attempt mate female mouse


provided male mouse gone puberty. will try mount mate
female mouse. Now female mice either receptive phase non-
receptive phase so-called estrous cycle. don't menstrual 28 day
cycle estrous cycle. particular days estrous cycle,
not happy mate. will basically keep hindquarters away male
mouse costs. even attack male mouse. certain days estrous
cycle, however, female mouse will undergo called lordosis,
arching back allow male mount mate her. large
number experiments done, first experiment really put male
mouse female mouse so-called receptive phase estrus. is,
will allow mating starts mating go standard
repertoire mating behaviors observe mice: mounting, thrusting,
intromission called mouse sex world. Well, guess don't know
mice call it, experimenters call it. afterwards will
dismount, okay. observe kind mounting sex behavior typical,
halfway behavior, Dayu turned light stimulate
estrogen receptor containing neurons male mouse observed
incredibly dramatic. male mouse ceases trying mate female
mouse immediately tries kill female mouse. starts attacking her.
turns off light, male stops goes back trying mate female mouse.
sure confusing disturbing female mouse.
Nonetheless, repertoire. mate. stimulate
ventromedial hypothalamus neurons. male mouse immediately try attack
kill female mouse. stop stimulation stop
trying attack kill female mouse, return attempt, least, mate
female mouse. dramatic shifts behavior triggered
activation small set neurons within ventromedial hypothalamus.
think can watch sort thing without disturbed,
encourage go YouTube. will provide link can see video
type behavior. incredibly dramatic. shift behavior almost
instantaneous, occurs within seconds, not milliseconds, thousandths second.
next experiment put male mouse stimulation light
capability ventromedial hypothalamus cage alone, rubber glove
filled air water. Mouse, walking around sniffing, peeing, male mice


seem do. seem urinate everywhere, actually interesting, perhaps
interesting feature male mice actually many male animals, perhaps even humans.
don't know, maybe know, basically observed time
time experiments, mainly Lisa Stowers's lab Scripps Institute,
characterized this. put female mice arena cage, always urinate
small corner cage. Whereas put mail mice arena cage,
urinate everywhere, obsession spraying urine everywhere,
can transpose human behavior like. event, Dayu put mouse
cage alone, rubber glove, mouse walking around urinating, et
cetera, whatever mice do, stimulates activation
ventromedial hypothalamus neurons, mouse immediately tries kill glove.
goes rage, attacking glove another mouse animate
object. course inanimate object. just rubber glove. stops
stimulation mouse immediately goes back completely calm least
not attacking. Again, don't know mouse feeling.
dramatic videos. Again, can see following link provide
caption. sort thing going disturb you, see, instance, attack, one
mouse attacking another, please just don't watch them. not interested traumatizing
anybody traumatizing yourself, is. number different variations done
experiment. instance, stimulating VMH female mice, opposed
male mice, putting female mice female mice male mice, no
matter variation one carries out, doesn't matter male female, male
male, female female, et cetera, stimulation ventromedial hypothalamus

00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts Aggression, Biting

male mouse female mouse evokes dramatic, almost instantaneous
aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done
Dayu Lin laboratory laboratories shown ventromedial
hypothalamus connected bunch brain areas interesting,
talk little bit, one want call now
so-called PAG, periaqueductal gray nucleus. large structure back
brain houses things like neurons can create opioids. know
opioid crisis, neurons can produce endogenous, means made


body, chemicals can cause pain relief. understand might occur
circuit aggression, right? Even one aggressor, likely may
incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing
stations, excuse me, arrive things like jaws. fact, stimulation
ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially
human children, biting something that, young children might form
aggression, tends disappear pretty early childhood. doesn't, often seen
mark pathology. story this, actually, kid, went
summer sports camp never forget this, playing soccer rare
stroke luck accident, happened score goal. wasn't particularly good soccer
player, especially not stage life. later figured just better
make fullback, 'cause just wait fullbacks do.
better taking ball person putting ball goal.
Nonetheless, I, again, chance, scored goal trotting back side
field, sudden felt sting back, kid, not named, although
remember name, not going tell name was. kid jumped
back bit top back. course resulted discussion
timeout usual things parents think got involved. don't recall, didn't
think much else it, recall considered especially troubling behavior
bit opposed hit shoved something sort,
seem tendency use biting aggressive behavior associated
primitive circuitry. Now truly anthropomorphizing. don't know
kid happened thinking feeling time, I? certainly
not going say biting every case reflects pathology, although think
general agreement psychology community, psychiatric community
past certain age, using one's teeth impart aggression damage others
particularly primitive troubling least observer person
experiencing pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab shown activation
ventromedial hypothalamus triggers downstream circuit periaqueductal gray
triggers whole set circuits fixed action patterns.
back Lorenz fixed action patterns, including swinging limbs, right punching.
wouldn't necessarily controlled punching, also biting behavior.


remarkable me, least circuits brain can evoke violent use
things like mouth violent use things like limbs. course used
things like singing kissing eating or, know, gesticulating kind polite
impolite way. point neural circuits,

00:35:56 Testosterone & Competitiveness/Estrogen & Aggression

not individual brain areas evoke constellation behaviors call aggression.
Now, many probably puzzled least talking
highly specialized brain area, ventromedial hypothalamus highly
specialized subcategory neurons ventromedial hypothalamus, neurons
make estrogen receptors. yet activation cells triggers dramatic
immediate aggression, males females males
females. going here? us think estrogen don't
immediately think aggression. us hear testosterone might think
aggression, although things well. order understand this, just want
briefly refer back conversation previous episode Huberman
Lab Podcast. colleague, great Robert Sapolsky course,
professor Stanford studied testosterone impacts behavior well
estrogen hormones impacts behavior. make long story short
dispel still unfortunately common myth. Testosterone not increase
aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity willingness lean effort
competitive scenarios. Sometimes referred challenge hypothesis,
make long story short, people given testosterone, look people
different levels, excuse me, testosterone, endogenously naturally
make. find testosterone tends increase competitiveness, not just
aggressive scenarios. somebody already aggressive, giving testosterone
will tendency make aggressive. somebody however
benevolent altruistic, giving testosterone will make benevolent
altruistic, least point. Now, course certain forms synthetic
testosterones known sports circles circles increase
aggressiveness way particular forms synthetic testosterones
work. general, experiments referring not done
using those, done using call traditional biological


forms testosterone resemble biological forms testosterone. fact,
Robert Sapolsky described really interesting experiment which, look
testosterone levels administer additional testosterone people
philanthropy, giving money organizations essentially good
organizations good. find increased
testosterone increasing testosterone makes people willing compete,
give money person room order, know, put air
quotes, "To Alpha person," giving money. act
altruistic benevolent philanthropy. not act aggression. course, don't
know people feeling underneath that. Again, can't anthropomorphize
project onto people feeling. point testosterone
not make people aggressive. experiments talking
now, actually activation estrogen receptor containing neurons
makes animals aggressive. turns evidence
certain context, estrogen can make people aggressive. going here?
Well, going testosterone can converted estrogen
process called aromatization. enzyme called aromatase. Anytime
word ends A-S-E, least context biology, almost always not
always, almost always enzyme. aromatase enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen, actually testosterone, aromatized, converted estrogen
binding estrogen containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
triggers aggression. want repeat that, not testosterone itself, triggers
aggression. testosterone aromatized estrogen within brain binding
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
evokes aggression dramatic aggression that. Now effect estrogen causing
aggression brain robust, much take mouse lacks
aromatase enzyme human lacks aromatase enzyme, exist,
reduction overall aggression, despite high levels testosterone.
people mice aromatase enzyme enzyme blocked, well,
doesn't matter much increase testosterone derivatives.
not observe aggression. runs counter everything know
think role testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.
can increase desire work challenge. said before, ran
pressure tested Robert Sapolsky working testosterone


role brain behavior many decades now. fair say testosterone
net effect making effort feel good, least increasing threshold
effort feels bad unsustainable. way changing activity
threshold activation brain structures, like amygdala brain structures
associated anxiety. next time somebody says, testosterone makes people
aggressive. can say, "Ah, no, actually estrogen makes people aggressive,
animals aggressive matter. Now course case males
relatively less estrogen circulating brain body females, right?
testes, not ovaries, testosterone required first place
order converted estrogen, activate aggressive circuit involving
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus.
nonetheless, estrogen final step. hormone aggression
hinges. think people, quite surprising finding. yet
perhaps one robust findings animal human literature,
relates hormones psychological states behavior. Now, course case
testosterone low, person animal will exhibit less aggressive
behavior, not reduced testosterone per se.
subsequent reduction testosterone,

00:43:00 Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression

meaning no testosterone aromatize estrogen, estrogen will also
lower. established not testosterone, testosterone converted
estrogen activates circuits aggression. nonetheless, still surprising,
right? mean, us don't think estrogen hormone stimulates
aggression, turns contextual. beautiful data showing
whether not estrogen stimulates aggression, can powerfully modulated whether
not days short days long. words, whether not lot
sunshine not. Now, obviously brain encased skull. doesn't really know
lot sunshine even though can see sun eyes,
can feel skin. Day length converted hormonal signals chemical
signals primary hormonal chemical signals involve melatonin dopamine
also stress hormones. make long story short, long days
get lot sunlight, eyes skin, melatonin levels


reduced. Melatonin hormone tends produce states sleepiness
quiescence. also tends activate pathways tend reduce things like breeding
sexual behavior. long days, dopamine increased. Dopamine molecule
associated feelings wellbeing motivation desire seek sorts
things, sorts motivated behaviors. long days provided getting
enough sunlight skin eyes, stress hormones, especially cortisol,
stress hormones reduced levels. estrogen levels
increased experimentally long day conditions, not evoke aggression.
However, short days, estrogen increased, heightened predisposition
aggression. makes perfect sense. think short days
biology brain body. short days, melatonin signal goes up.
melatonin circulating 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones
circulating more. Why? Short days tend associated winter. winter,
bombarded bacterial viruses bacterial viruses actually survive better
cold heat. fact, laboratory, work lot viruses
bacteria want keep alive, put freezer. want
kill them, want inoculate them, put UV light. Like see
sunlight. shorter days conducive aggression. Not days
short per se,

00:45:46 Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors

stress hormone levels higher dopamine levels lower.
Now, starts converge clear biological picture,
clear psychological picture, indeed clear set tools can think
use. conditions cortisol high, stress hormone elevated
conditions neuromodulator serotonin reduced greater
propensity estrogen trigger aggression. Now, again, know said before,
males make lot testosterone relative estrogen, swap
mind idea testosterone high, means estrogen low
can true periphery body, testosterone high, going
aromatization, conversion testosterone estrogen. anytime hear
testosterone high, think testosterone high body perhaps
estrogen low body. means going heightened levels


estrogen brain therefore increased propensity aggression. females
generally make less testosterone relative estrogen, sufficient estrogen already
present trigger aggression. males females primed aggression,
riding context context whether not get tendency
aggression not. depends whether not cortisol high low, telling
cortisol relatively higher individual, going tilt, increase
hydraulic pressure Lorenz talked toward aggression. serotonin,
neuromodulator associated feelings wellbeing sometimes even
slight passivity, certainly wellbeing, serotonin low, also going
shift towards aggressive tendency. return Lorenz's hydraulic
pressure model aggression internal states, realize external stimuli,
things hear, things see, instance, someone saying something
upsetting us, seeing somebody something don't like others us,
well internal state, subjective feelings wellbeing, also stress level,
feelings whether not enough resources content
have. converging thing call internal state creating
pressure either aggressive less aggressive. now
major players feeding final pathway. question whether not will hit
other, person, will say thing considered aggressive? Will not say it?
somebody says something something aggressive us, will respond will
submissive even passive? Again, many things funneling
question dictating whether not answer is, "Absolutely fight back," or, "I'm
going attack even unprovoked." say this, going that, no
matter do, not going respond. kinds things complex.
yet really can boil just common elements. telling
elements whether not cortisol levels relatively lower relatively
higher. Again, relatively higher going tend make people reactive. Why?
reactivity really function autonomic nervous system, sort
like seesaw oscillates so-called sympathetic arm autonomic
nervous system, tends put us state readiness release
adrenaline. Cortisol adrenaline circulating brain body, make us
likely move react speak. actually will induce kind low
level tremor, anticipatory tremor able move quickly, right?
body motion easily set motion, is, neuromodulator


serotonin neuromodulator general associated feelings wellbeing
response already have. well fed, serotonin tends
released brain body, particular, well fed carbohydrates, precursor
serotonin tryptophan. indeed nice studies exploring types diets,
nutritional programs can reduce aggressive behavior, children adults
tryptophan-rich diets supplementation tryptophan. tryptophan rich
diets, things like white turkey meat, also number carbohydrates
can look up. easy find foods contain lots tryptophan. foods
contain precursor serotonin. Now isn't simply case eating foods
tryptophan will tend reduce aggression. suppose that, ate
abundance, make tired less likely aggressive,
don't recommend strategy, idea explored,
increasing levels tryptophan either supplementation food drugs,
prescription drugs increase serotonin. instance, fluoxetine sometimes called
Prozac Zoloft number SSRIs tend reduce aggressive behavior.
Now, not always, general, case. Similarly, elevated cortisol
tends shift whole system, again, create hydraulic pressure towards
aggressive states. cortisol levels reduced, well tendency aggressive
behavior reduced. supported number peer reviewed studies.
provide links caption show notes. going return
bit later context specific studies looked genetic variants
different individuals cause make less serotonin, least
metabolize serotonin differently. also case so-called intermittent explosive
disorder can often associated gene variants control much serotonin
made

00:51:56 Tool: Omega-3 Supplementation & Mood

metabolized much cortisol made much metabolized.
thinking tools number things one consider. First all,
number decent studies exploring supplementation Omega-3 fatty
acids, precursors transmitter systems, including serotonin
can modulate not directly mediate, modulate mood emotional tone
supplementation omega 3 S shown reduce impulsivity


aggressiveness certain contexts things like ADHD individuals
predisposition aggressive type behavior aggressive thinking. Now doesn't
necessarily mean omega 3 fatty acids going directly ventromedial
hypothalamus changing activity neurons likely causing
modulating overall shift mood immune system, hormone
systems changing overall tone propensity neurons
ventromedial hypothalamus activated. much omega 3 fatty acid, source?
Well, talked podcast before. can, course get omega 3
fatty acids number different foods. Getting whole foods probably
best way it, many people, including people depression will often
supplement one gram omega 3 fatty acid per day. people
including will take every day just general mood enhancer. don't suffer
depression, found beneficial health. people
that, talked before, double blind placebo controlled studies, people
taking one three grams omega 3 fatty acids per day, typically form high
quality fish oil, although sources well, algae forth, can
experience improvements mood par SSRIs, selective
serotonin reuptake inhibitors. course, prescribed SSRI
psychiatrist doctor, please take don't cease take just simply
take omega 3s. However might mention them, can find links
studies previous episodes depression supplementation omega 3 fatty
acids one gram EPA specifically, getting one gram
threshold, high three grams per day EPA allowed people

00:54:18 Tool: Sunlight, Sauna & Cortisol Reduction

take lower doses SSRIs still keep mood place beneficial
them. terms keeping cortisol range healthy doesn't bias
someone toward high levels aggression irritability, again, going set
number larger modulators contextual cues. talked
podcast, just briefly recap now, obviously getting sunlight eyes
early day, much sunlight safely can eyes throughout day
going important. Again, effect estrogen long days, not
increasing aggression, however, shorter days, estrogen increases aggression


increase cortisol observed short days. Another way reduce
cortisol discussed episode heat use sauna heat, also
hot baths. turns hot baths sauna can beneficial reducing
cortisol. details included episode heat timestamped,
can go directly want learn temperatures various
durations, just give synopsis that, 20 minute sauna anywhere 80
hundred degrees Celsius going beneficial reducing cortisol. don't
access sauna, hot bath, adjust temperature don't
burn yourself. think 80 hundred degrees Celsius going hot many
people hot bath, whereas many people can't tolerate hot bath can
tolerate sauna. safety first always, course,

00:55:54 Tool: Ashwagandha & Cortisol Reduction

hot baths reduce cortisol, hot saunas, reduce cortisol duration 20 30
minutes going beneficial. course, may interested
exploring supplementation route reductions cortisol, really chief player
ashwagandha, known decrease cortisol, fairly potently. just
warn going use ashwagandha order reduce cortisol, first all,
check doctor healthcare provider adding subtracting anything
supplementation health regimen. course, don't just say protect us.
say protect you, responsible health, take
don't take. Chronic supplementation ashwagandha can not great
effects disruption hormone pathways neurotransmitter pathways.
limit seems two weeks regular use want take break
two weeks. ashwagandha again, potent inhibitor cortisol,
effects well, don't use chronically longer two weeks.
goal reduce cortisol, say going period increased irritability
aggressive tendency, maybe also not getting much light like,
perhaps also, circumstantial things leading towards

00:57:06 Tool: Seasonality/Sunlight, Genetic Variation Estrogen Sensitivity

aggressiveness goal reduce aggressiveness, can potentially


helpful. light stuff cortisol estrogen day length,
mention fact, people genetic predisposition
irritable aggressive, couple different gene pathways
associated this. never like think just one gene causing specific
behavior. way think genes genes generally code things within

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring

context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous

simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,

things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard

alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,

experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural

make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000

almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments

describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions

not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring

context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,

things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard

even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even

off aggression, although others drawn aggression
observing others. reason talk aggression is, mentioned
before, context aggression really matters. instances
aggression adaptive. instance, mother protecting children
attacked, children threatened. think people agree
so-called maternal aggression sort, provided context right, great thing.
Protecting young one primary adaptive drives species,
thank goodness is. course, forms aggression like unprovoked, proactive
aggression, somebody simply violent somebody else, even unprovoked,
us cringe see kind behavior, can even evoke aggression
people observe kind behavior. again, context really matters,
general perhaps even important reason think
understand aggression understanding biology psychology
aggression, will much better position understand emotional states
come be, others. instance, many probably
heard statement believe arises pop psychology, not formal academic
psychology, aggression just sadness. form sadness amplified
shows aggression. look underlying biology peer
reviewed literature this, nothing truth. distinct


circuits brain aggression versus grief mourning, non-overlapping.
Now doesn't mean can't sad aggressive state mourning
aggressive time, idea sadness aggression one
thing simply not true. understanding that, perhaps
understanding irritability aggression not thing, much
better position apply tools will talk episode order
able reduce eliminate, adaptive modulate aggression. yes,
cases modulating aggression cases, even amplifying
aggression can adaptive. Now course not first discussion
biology aggression psychology aggression. really can look
beginning last century time formal study aggression really
began. One names associated formal study aggression
none Konrad Lorenz. may familiar name, others
may not familiar name. Konrad Lorenz studied so-called imprinting
behaviors fixed action pattern behaviors. famous, least scientific
circles, getting geese believe parent. put
Google Conrad K, Lorenz, just sounds, Konrad Lorenz, geese, going
see lot photos Conrad walking roads lot geese following
swimming lakes lot geese following him. habit geese adopting
behaviors partook in. swim lake front
bunch little geese think parent
imprint him. even lived animals lived him, sort
strange character hear. nonetheless, work deserving
Nobel prize discovered fixed action patterns. patterns
behavior evoked single stimulus. Okay. really important.
idea can get whole category behaviors, like swimming behind parent,
looking somebody comfort, them, idea get huge
category different behaviors bunch different contexts triggered just
presence person remarkable, suggested turns
true neural circuits, not just individual brain areas, collections
brain areas work together engage pattern behaviors. first
fundamental principle need define today, talk aggression,
talking activation neural circuits, not individual brain areas, neural
circuits get played sequence like keys piano, playing


sequence means aggression verb. beginning, middle end,
process. not event. see, turns important
terms thinking one can halt aggression, prevent happening
initiated, maybe even prolonging aggression, needed. Now, Konrad
Lorenz no real knowledge neural circuits. mean, obviously knew
thing call brain nervous system, knew
chemicals brain hormones things sort likely play
role, really didn't take measures define neural circuits were,
frankly, didn't need to. Nobel prize beautiful work.
known abundance work, think sorts underlying
processes drive something like aggression. talked one particular
feature especially important, notion pressure. idea yes,
certain hormones will bias somebody animal aggressive, certain neural
transmitter states, learn today will bias somebody
less aggressive, maybe even submissive passive, maybe outright proactively
aggressive towards anyone anything front them. yes, course will
historical features based childhood, et cetera, et cetera. understood
will constellation things drive people aggressive.
described so-called pressure, almost like hydraulic pressure. Just think fluid
pressure small container pushed, pushed, pushed can,
container ready explode multiple features, multiple variables impinge
create pressure. turns exactly way system works.
no single brain area flips switch aggression. Although soon talk
brain structure generally houses propensity output
aggression. notion hydraulic pressure can drive us toward aggressive
behavior conversely can low pressure keep us state non-reactivity,
maybe even passivity submissiveness important feature really
captures essence neural circuits work talking primitive
behaviors generally. can start notice others, can
start notice veering toward aggression someone veering
toward aggression, verbal physical. Now veering buildup hydraulic
pressure

00:15:50 Brain Regions Controlling Aggression, Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH)



Lorenz referring to, really underlying biological basis. Now
years later first experiments came along, really started
identify brain areas biological so-called pressures can induce
aggressive behavior. person really gets credit guy name
Walter Hess, time working cats. know say working
cats, lot people will cringe. lot people cats pets, certainly cats
can delightful. people like more, people like less. people
cringe idea experiments cats. say days,
laboratories work cats. laboratories work animal models will work
flies, Drosophila fruit flies capacity genetics, laboratory mice,
sometimes rats, usually mice. occasionally find lab still works
cats. Back time Hess, laboratories worked mice, laboratories
worked cats rats. reason nowadays laboratories use mice
use animal models genetic tools exist mice knock

primates, least not easily point history. say working
cats, realized probably evokes negative emotions you, maybe
even aggression you, can do, however, look data make
use data terms understanding. Hess cats

mind brain not pain sensors. small hole made

obviously took notice incredible transformation behavior. fact
turned off stimulation particular brain area, cat quickly within
seconds, went back passive calm kitty. Now, course, repeated
experiment animals confirm wasn't just happenstance,
wasn't something unique one cat perhaps stimulated
area built kittenhood cat reactivated.
Maybe kitten traumatized early life scared reactivation
particular circuit, unique cat created aggressive behavior. wasn't
case, every cat looked stimulated particular brain area, cat
immediately go aggressive, almost rage type behavior. Now, course can't
anthropomorphize. don't know cat feeling. know cat
happy, although seems pretty unlikely later experiments done mice,
also humans confirm indeed, stimulation brain area evoked not just
behavioral aggression, also subjective feelings aggression anger.
incredible brain area, rather, say, brain area
harbored incredible capacity generate aggressive behavior Hess's
experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural
circuits, oftentimes center back amygdala prefrontal cortex,
names will come up. haven't heard before, don't worry,
make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000
neurons so, not exactly 3000, 3000 neurons sufficient generate
aggressive behavior sort Hess observed cat, believe not,
see somebody act rage act verbal aggression act
defensive aggression, protecting family loved ones country, et cetera,
almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments
done just recently within last 10 years so, leading right year
even last month keep confirming again,


activity neurons ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,
ventromedial hypothalamus mouse, pretty straightforward
sort known started experiments. analyzed
genes, meaning DNA, course becomes RNA RNA becomes protein,
DNA therefore proteins expressed particular cells
ventromedial hypothalamus. turns particular category neurons
ventromedial hypothalamus make estrogen receptor.
neurons particular responsible generating aggressive behavior.
know this? Well, used tool actually described previous guest
podcast. episode psychiatrist bioengineer
colleague Stanford School Medicine, Karl Deisseroth, others
developed tools allow people control activity neurons essentially remote
control, shining light neurons. context experiment
mouse, David's lab did, beautiful experiments Dayu
Lin now laboratory New York University, put little fiber optic cable

thin wire. little thin wire actually little call optrode.
experimentalist case, Dayu, able stimulate turning little bit

cage another mouse, couple things happen depending
mouse is, say mouse is. male mouse put
female mouse, male mouse will attempt mate female mouse


provided male mouse gone puberty. will try mount mate
female mouse. Now female mice either receptive phase non-
receptive phase so-called estrous cycle. don't menstrual 28 day
cycle estrous cycle. particular days estrous cycle,
not happy mate. will basically keep hindquarters away male
mouse costs. even attack male mouse. certain days estrous
cycle, however, female mouse will undergo called lordosis,
arching back allow male mount mate her. large
number experiments done, first experiment really put male
mouse female mouse so-called receptive phase estrus. is,
will allow mating starts mating go standard
repertoire mating behaviors observe mice: mounting, thrusting,
intromission called mouse sex world. Well, guess don't know
mice call it, experimenters call it. afterwards will
dismount, okay. observe kind mounting sex behavior typical,
halfway behavior, Dayu turned light stimulate
estrogen receptor containing neurons male mouse observed
incredibly dramatic. male mouse ceases trying mate female
mouse immediately tries kill female mouse. starts attacking her.
turns off light, male stops goes back trying mate female mouse.
sure confusing disturbing female mouse.
Nonetheless, repertoire. mate. stimulate
ventromedial hypothalamus neurons. male mouse immediately try attack

instantaneous, occurs within seconds, not milliseconds, thousandths second.
next experiment put male mouse stimulation light

seem do. seem urinate everywhere, actually interesting, perhaps
interesting feature male mice actually many male animals, perhaps even humans.
don't know, maybe know, basically observed time

characterized this. put female mice arena cage, always urinate
small corner cage. Whereas put mail mice arena cage,
urinate everywhere, obsession spraying urine everywhere,

00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts Aggression, Biting

male mouse female mouse evokes dramatic, almost instantaneous
aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done
Dayu Lin laboratory laboratories shown ventromedial
hypothalamus connected bunch brain areas interesting,
talk little bit, one want call now
so-called PAG, periaqueductal gray nucleus. large structure back
brain houses things like neurons can create opioids. know
opioid crisis, neurons can produce endogenous, means made


body, chemicals can cause pain relief. understand might occur
circuit aggression, right? Even one aggressor, likely may
incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing
stations, excuse me, arrive things like jaws. fact, stimulation
ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially
human children, biting something that, young children might form
aggression, tends disappear pretty early childhood. doesn't, often seen
mark pathology. story this, actually, kid, went
summer sports camp never forget this, playing soccer rare
stroke luck accident, happened score goal. wasn't particularly good soccer
player, especially not stage life. later figured just better
make fullback, 'cause just wait fullbacks do.
better taking ball person putting ball goal.
Nonetheless, I, again, chance, scored goal trotting back side
field, sudden felt sting back, kid, not named, although
remember name, not going tell name was. kid jumped
back bit top back. course resulted discussion
timeout usual things parents think got involved. don't recall, didn't
think much else it, recall considered especially troubling behavior
bit opposed hit shoved something sort,
seem tendency use biting aggressive behavior associated
primitive circuitry. Now truly anthropomorphizing. don't know
kid happened thinking feeling time, I? certainly
not going say biting every case reflects pathology, although think
general agreement psychology community, psychiatric community
past certain age, using one's teeth impart aggression damage others
particularly primitive troubling least observer person
experiencing pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab shown activation
ventromedial hypothalamus triggers downstream circuit periaqueductal gray
triggers whole set circuits fixed action patterns.
back Lorenz fixed action patterns, including swinging limbs, right punching.
wouldn't necessarily controlled punching, also biting behavior.


remarkable me, least circuits brain can evoke violent use
things like mouth violent use things like limbs. course used
things like singing kissing eating or, know, gesticulating kind polite
impolite way. point neural circuits,

00:35:56 Testosterone & Competitiveness/Estrogen & Aggression

not individual brain areas evoke constellation behaviors call aggression.
Now, many probably puzzled least talking
highly specialized brain area, ventromedial hypothalamus highly
specialized subcategory neurons ventromedial hypothalamus, neurons
make estrogen receptors. yet activation cells triggers dramatic
immediate aggression, males females males
females. going here? us think estrogen don't
immediately think aggression. us hear testosterone might think
aggression, although things well. order understand this, just want
briefly refer back conversation previous episode Huberman
Lab Podcast. colleague, great Robert Sapolsky course,
professor Stanford studied testosterone impacts behavior well
estrogen hormones impacts behavior. make long story short
dispel still unfortunately common myth. Testosterone not increase
aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity willingness lean effort
competitive scenarios. Sometimes referred challenge hypothesis,
make long story short, people given testosterone, look people
different levels, excuse me, testosterone, endogenously naturally
make. find testosterone tends increase competitiveness, not just
aggressive scenarios. somebody already aggressive, giving testosterone
will tendency make aggressive. somebody however
benevolent altruistic, giving testosterone will make benevolent
altruistic, least point. Now, course certain forms synthetic
testosterones known sports circles circles increase
aggressiveness way particular forms synthetic testosterones
work. general, experiments referring not done
using those, done using call traditional biological


forms testosterone resemble biological forms testosterone. fact,
Robert Sapolsky described really interesting experiment which, look
testosterone levels administer additional testosterone people
philanthropy, giving money organizations essentially good
organizations good. find increased
testosterone increasing testosterone makes people willing compete,
give money person room order, know, put air
quotes, "To Alpha person," giving money. act
altruistic benevolent philanthropy. not act aggression. course, don't
know people feeling underneath that. Again, can't anthropomorphize
project onto people feeling. point testosterone
not make people aggressive. experiments talking
now, actually activation estrogen receptor containing neurons
makes animals aggressive. turns evidence
certain context, estrogen can make people aggressive. going here?
Well, going testosterone can converted estrogen
process called aromatization. enzyme called aromatase. Anytime
word ends A-S-E, least context biology, almost always not
always, almost always enzyme. aromatase enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen, actually testosterone, aromatized, converted estrogen
binding estrogen containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
triggers aggression. want repeat that, not testosterone itself, triggers
aggression. testosterone aromatized estrogen within brain binding
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
evokes aggression dramatic aggression that. Now effect estrogen causing
aggression brain robust, much take mouse lacks
aromatase enzyme human lacks aromatase enzyme, exist,
reduction overall aggression, despite high levels testosterone.
people mice aromatase enzyme enzyme blocked, well,
doesn't matter much increase testosterone derivatives.
not observe aggression. runs counter everything know
think role testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.
can increase desire work challenge. said before, ran
pressure tested Robert Sapolsky working testosterone


role brain behavior many decades now. fair say testosterone
net effect making effort feel good, least increasing threshold
effort feels bad unsustainable. way changing activity
threshold activation brain structures, like amygdala brain structures
associated anxiety. next time somebody says, testosterone makes people
aggressive. can say, "Ah, no, actually estrogen makes people aggressive,
animals aggressive matter. Now course case males
relatively less estrogen circulating brain body females, right?
testes, not ovaries, testosterone required first place
order converted estrogen, activate aggressive circuit involving
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus.
nonetheless, estrogen final step. hormone aggression
hinges. think people, quite surprising finding. yet
perhaps one robust findings animal human literature,
relates hormones psychological states behavior. Now, course case
testosterone low, person animal will exhibit less aggressive
behavior, not reduced testosterone per se.
subsequent reduction testosterone,

00:43:00 Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression

meaning no testosterone aromatize estrogen, estrogen will also
lower. established not testosterone, testosterone converted
estrogen activates circuits aggression. nonetheless, still surprising,
right? mean, us don't think estrogen hormone stimulates
aggression, turns contextual. beautiful data showing
whether not estrogen stimulates aggression, can powerfully modulated whether
not days short days long. words, whether not lot
sunshine not. Now, obviously brain encased skull. doesn't really know
lot sunshine even though can see sun eyes,
can feel skin. Day length converted hormonal signals chemical
signals primary hormonal chemical signals involve melatonin dopamine
also stress hormones. make long story short, long days
get lot sunlight, eyes skin, melatonin levels


reduced. Melatonin hormone tends produce states sleepiness
quiescence. also tends activate pathways tend reduce things like breeding
sexual behavior. long days, dopamine increased. Dopamine molecule
associated feelings wellbeing motivation desire seek sorts
things, sorts motivated behaviors. long days provided getting
enough sunlight skin eyes, stress hormones, especially cortisol,
stress hormones reduced levels. estrogen levels
increased experimentally long day conditions, not evoke aggression.
However, short days, estrogen increased, heightened predisposition
aggression. makes perfect sense. think short days
biology brain body. short days, melatonin signal goes up.
melatonin circulating 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones
circulating more. Why? Short days tend associated winter. winter,
bombarded bacterial viruses bacterial viruses actually survive better
cold heat. fact, laboratory, work lot viruses
bacteria want keep alive, put freezer. want
kill them, want inoculate them, put UV light. Like see
sunlight. shorter days conducive aggression. Not days
short per se,

00:45:46 Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors

stress hormone levels higher dopamine levels lower.
Now, starts converge clear biological picture,
clear psychological picture, indeed clear set tools can think
use. conditions cortisol high, stress hormone elevated
conditions neuromodulator serotonin reduced greater
propensity estrogen trigger aggression. Now, again, know said before,
males make lot testosterone relative estrogen, swap
mind idea testosterone high, means estrogen low
can true periphery body, testosterone high, going
aromatization, conversion testosterone estrogen. anytime hear
testosterone high, think testosterone high body perhaps
estrogen low body. means going heightened levels


estrogen brain therefore increased propensity aggression. females
generally make less testosterone relative estrogen, sufficient estrogen already
present trigger aggression. males females primed aggression,
riding context context whether not get tendency
aggression not. depends whether not cortisol high low, telling
cortisol relatively higher individual, going tilt, increase
hydraulic pressure Lorenz talked toward aggression. serotonin,
neuromodulator associated feelings wellbeing sometimes even
slight passivity, certainly wellbeing, serotonin low, also going
shift towards aggressive tendency. return Lorenz's hydraulic
pressure model aggression internal states, realize external stimuli,
things hear, things see, instance, someone saying something
upsetting us, seeing somebody something don't like others us,
well internal state, subjective feelings wellbeing, also stress level,
feelings whether not enough resources content
have. converging thing call internal state creating
pressure either aggressive less aggressive. now
major players feeding final pathway. question whether not will hit
other, person, will say thing considered aggressive? Will not say it?
somebody says something something aggressive us, will respond will
submissive even passive? Again, many things funneling
question dictating whether not answer is, "Absolutely fight back," or, "I'm
going attack even unprovoked." say this, going that, no
matter do, not going respond. kinds things complex.
yet really can boil just common elements. telling
elements whether not cortisol levels relatively lower relatively
higher. Again, relatively higher going tend make people reactive. Why?
reactivity really function autonomic nervous system, sort
like seesaw oscillates so-called sympathetic arm autonomic
nervous system, tends put us state readiness release
adrenaline. Cortisol adrenaline circulating brain body, make us
likely move react speak. actually will induce kind low
level tremor, anticipatory tremor able move quickly, right?
body motion easily set motion, is, neuromodulator


serotonin neuromodulator general associated feelings wellbeing
response already have. well fed, serotonin tends
released brain body, particular, well fed carbohydrates, precursor
serotonin tryptophan. indeed nice studies exploring types diets,
nutritional programs can reduce aggressive behavior, children adults
tryptophan-rich diets supplementation tryptophan. tryptophan rich
diets, things like white turkey meat, also number carbohydrates
can look up. easy find foods contain lots tryptophan. foods
contain precursor serotonin. Now isn't simply case eating foods
tryptophan will tend reduce aggression. suppose that, ate
abundance, make tired less likely aggressive,
don't recommend strategy, idea explored,
increasing levels tryptophan either supplementation food drugs,
prescription drugs increase serotonin. instance, fluoxetine sometimes called
Prozac Zoloft number SSRIs tend reduce aggressive behavior.
Now, not always, general, case. Similarly, elevated cortisol
tends shift whole system, again, create hydraulic pressure towards
aggressive states. cortisol levels reduced, well tendency aggressive
behavior reduced. supported number peer reviewed studies.

01:00:37 Testosterone & Aggression, Competitive Work Environments

regardless time year, regardless whether not happen
particular genetic variant. earlier talked testosterone converted
estrogen activating aggression ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone
itself. However, studies carried humans evaluated
effects testosterone levels testosterone correlate aggressiveness
short term. just going detail studies think
interesting important. First all, study explored levels
testosterone men different professions. Now, tell data, want
clear here, study this, one never knows whether not men
went particular profession testosterone level given value
whether not work altered testosterone levels both. think
fair assume probably both. careful assuming given
testosterone level causal choosing particular career particular career
causal creating particular testosterone level. study used salivary testosterone
levels measure, fair not best way measure testosterone.
Typically blood draw best way measure testosterone, nonetheless,
provided appropriate methods used, salivary testosterone can reasonable
measure testosterone. different occupations looked were,
just looked men particular study ministers, salesmen, didn't say
particular types salesmen, firemen, professors, things, physicians NFL
players. discovered testosterone levels essentially
order low highest. minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL
player. Now micro dissect different stereotypes different
features jobs. instance, don't know whether not fact


firemen happened, least study lower testosterone levels average
professors physicians firemen lower testosterone
levels much stressful job cortisol levels
higher professor physician cortisol testosterone, not always,
generally somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode derive
precursor, et cetera. Typically, cortisol high, testosterone tends
lower vice versa. don't know causing effects. again,
just one study just six occupations, think relatively interesting given fact
professions involves different levels competitiveness, right?
don't necessarily just want think level physical exertion required,
also level competitiveness known competitive interactions
can cause increases testosterone, particular, winners competitive
interactions, topic future podcast. Meanwhile, studies analyzed also
again, salivary testosterone prisoners, case, female prisoners,
incarcerated individuals, looked levels testosterone according whether
not person committed non-violent violent crime order arrive prison.
higher levels salivary testosterone related arrived prison
conviction violent crime, opposed nonviolent crime. Likewise,
analyzed prison rule violations, indirect measure aggressiveness,
case, strongly associated aggressiveness knew
violations were, found prisoners none, no prison violations, prison
rule violations say, testosterone levels tended lower
testosterone levels women some, even one, aggressive violations
prison rules. provide links studies show notes like go
further, obviously studies like need taken grain salt
many different factors, different prisons different degrees

01:05:07 Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort

violence begin competitiveness begin with. just final pass
examining role testosterone aggressiveness,
interesting study Goetz, et al, G-O-E-T-Z published 2014, looked serum,
case, blood levels testosterone. 30 minutes application gel-based

often discussed many effects steroid hormones like testosterone,
estrogen slow acting. fact, steroid hormones, certain
biochemical composition can actually pass membranes cells,
outside cell nucleus cell change gene expression cell,
think puberty, kid goes home summer comes back
looking completely different. Well lot genes got turned
steroid hormones like testosterone estrogen, steroid hormones can also
fast acting effects testosterone particular, can remarkably
fast acting one apparent well documented fast acting effects
effect: ability activate cells within amygdala, might say, "Well, thought
amygdala associated fear?" Wouldn't testosterone cause fear? No.
Turns amygdala harbors, cortisol, corticosteroid receptors
testosterone receptors, adjust activity amygdala differently,
testosterone tends activate amygdala circuitry inducing states mind

exogenous makes people aggressive, tell no, testosterone tends make people
lean effort. effort involves aggressive, either reactively aggressive
proactively aggressive,

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis
deploy bunch chemicals jut rest body, activate adrenaline


release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing
arousal readiness,

01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression

tendency impulsivity alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
different mechanism. really interesting study, just mention title
study is, "Caffeinated non-caffeinated alcohol use indirect aggression
impact self-regulation." title almost self-explanatory. paper
published Journal Addictive Behavior 2016, examining ingestion
alcohol either caffeinated non-decaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted
call indirect aggression. just remind indirect aggression is, not
physical acts aggression. verbal acts aggression, embarrassing


others otherwise, somehow trying reduce wellbeing others saying certain
things particular groups, study examined males females.
done way college campus study, subjects 18 47 years old. guess
older students campus, maybe use non-students,
know, days also got students thirties forties.
fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum
people different backgrounds. looked particular people ingested non-
caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never
really liked drugs alcohol sort fortunate way can drink not drink
tend not drink. me, 9.18, drinks per week sounds like lot, know
people might actually typical. others drinking least one
caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. individuals end high, say
7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. energy drinks
combined, typically hard alcohol, fairly commonly available bars
forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,
alcohol tends sedative suppressive effect autonomic nervous system,


least initial period, going tend reduce likelihood people will
engage type behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal
increase likelihood someone will engage particular type behavior,

01:24:10 Factors Affecting “Hydraulic Pressure Model” Aggression

obviously avoiding things like alcohol appears study just described,

incredible brain area, rather, say, brain area
harbored incredible capacity generate aggressive behavior Hess's
experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural
circuits, oftentimes center back amygdala prefrontal cortex,
names will come up. haven't heard before, don't worry,
make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000
neurons so, not exactly 3000, 3000 neurons sufficient generate
aggressive behavior sort Hess observed cat, believe not,
see somebody act rage act verbal aggression act
defensive aggression, protecting family loved ones country, et cetera,
almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments
done just recently within last 10 years so, leading right year
even last month keep confirming again,


activity neurons ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,

context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,

things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard

even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,

frankly, didn't need to. Nobel prize beautiful work.
known abundance work, think sorts underlying

00:15:50 Brain Regions Controlling Aggression, Ventromedial Hypothalamus (VMH)



Lorenz referring to, really underlying biological basis. Now
years later first experiments came along, really started

experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural
circuits, oftentimes center back amygdala prefrontal cortex,
names will come up. haven't heard before, don't worry,
make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000
neurons so, not exactly 3000, 3000 neurons sufficient generate
aggressive behavior sort Hess observed cat, believe not,
see somebody act rage act verbal aggression act
defensive aggression, protecting family loved ones country, et cetera,
almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments
done just recently within last 10 years so, leading right year
even last month keep confirming again,


activity neurons ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,
ventromedial hypothalamus mouse, pretty straightforward
sort known started experiments. analyzed
genes, meaning DNA, course becomes RNA RNA becomes protein,
DNA therefore proteins expressed particular cells
ventromedial hypothalamus. turns particular category neurons
ventromedial hypothalamus make estrogen receptor.
neurons particular responsible generating aggressive behavior.
know this? Well, used tool actually described previous guest
podcast. episode psychiatrist bioengineer
colleague Stanford School Medicine, Karl Deisseroth, others
developed tools allow people control activity neurons essentially remote
control, shining light neurons. context experiment

mouse is, say mouse is. male mouse put
female mouse, male mouse will attempt mate female mouse


provided male mouse gone puberty. will try mount mate
female mouse. Now female mice either receptive phase non-
receptive phase so-called estrous cycle. don't menstrual 28 day
cycle estrous cycle. particular days estrous cycle,
not happy mate. will basically keep hindquarters away male
mouse costs. even attack male mouse. certain days estrous
cycle, however, female mouse will undergo called lordosis,
arching back allow male mount mate her. large
number experiments done, first experiment really put male
mouse female mouse so-called receptive phase estrus. is,
will allow mating starts mating go standard
repertoire mating behaviors observe mice: mounting, thrusting,
intromission called mouse sex world. Well, guess don't know
mice call it, experimenters call it. afterwards will
dismount, okay. observe kind mounting sex behavior typical,
halfway behavior, Dayu turned light stimulate

incredibly dramatic. male mouse ceases trying mate female

turns off light, male stops goes back trying mate female mouse.
sure confusing disturbing female mouse.
Nonetheless, repertoire. mate. stimulate

next experiment put male mouse stimulation light

00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts Aggression, Biting

male mouse female mouse evokes dramatic, almost instantaneous
aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done
Dayu Lin laboratory laboratories shown ventromedial
hypothalamus connected bunch brain areas interesting,
talk little bit, one want call now
so-called PAG, periaqueductal gray nucleus. large structure back
brain houses things like neurons can create opioids. know
opioid crisis, neurons can produce endogenous, means made


body, chemicals can cause pain relief. understand might occur
circuit aggression, right? Even one aggressor, likely may
incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing
stations, excuse me, arrive things like jaws. fact, stimulation
ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially
human children, biting something that, young children might form
aggression, tends disappear pretty early childhood. doesn't, often seen
mark pathology. story this, actually, kid, went
summer sports camp never forget this, playing soccer rare
stroke luck accident, happened score goal. wasn't particularly good soccer
player, especially not stage life. later figured just better
make fullback, 'cause just wait fullbacks do.
better taking ball person putting ball goal.
Nonetheless, I, again, chance, scored goal trotting back side
field, sudden felt sting back, kid, not named, although
remember name, not going tell name was. kid jumped
back bit top back. course resulted discussion
timeout usual things parents think got involved. don't recall, didn't
think much else it, recall considered especially troubling behavior
bit opposed hit shoved something sort,
seem tendency use biting aggressive behavior associated
primitive circuitry. Now truly anthropomorphizing. don't know
kid happened thinking feeling time, I? certainly
not going say biting every case reflects pathology, although think
general agreement psychology community, psychiatric community
past certain age, using one's teeth impart aggression damage others
particularly primitive troubling least observer person
experiencing pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab shown activation
ventromedial hypothalamus triggers downstream circuit periaqueductal gray
triggers whole set circuits fixed action patterns.
back Lorenz fixed action patterns, including swinging limbs, right punching.
wouldn't necessarily controlled punching, also biting behavior.


remarkable me, least circuits brain can evoke violent use
things like mouth violent use things like limbs. course used
things like singing kissing eating or, know, gesticulating kind polite
impolite way. point neural circuits,

00:35:56 Testosterone & Competitiveness/Estrogen & Aggression

not individual brain areas evoke constellation behaviors call aggression.
Now, many probably puzzled least talking
highly specialized brain area, ventromedial hypothalamus highly
specialized subcategory neurons ventromedial hypothalamus, neurons
make estrogen receptors. yet activation cells triggers dramatic
immediate aggression, males females males
females. going here? us think estrogen don't
immediately think aggression. us hear testosterone might think
aggression, although things well. order understand this, just want
briefly refer back conversation previous episode Huberman
Lab Podcast. colleague, great Robert Sapolsky course,
professor Stanford studied testosterone impacts behavior well
estrogen hormones impacts behavior. make long story short
dispel still unfortunately common myth. Testosterone not increase
aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity willingness lean effort
competitive scenarios. Sometimes referred challenge hypothesis,
make long story short, people given testosterone, look people
different levels, excuse me, testosterone, endogenously naturally
make. find testosterone tends increase competitiveness, not just
aggressive scenarios. somebody already aggressive, giving testosterone
will tendency make aggressive. somebody however
benevolent altruistic, giving testosterone will make benevolent
altruistic, least point. Now, course certain forms synthetic
testosterones known sports circles circles increase
aggressiveness way particular forms synthetic testosterones
work. general, experiments referring not done
using those, done using call traditional biological


forms testosterone resemble biological forms testosterone. fact,
Robert Sapolsky described really interesting experiment which, look
testosterone levels administer additional testosterone people
philanthropy, giving money organizations essentially good
organizations good. find increased
testosterone increasing testosterone makes people willing compete,
give money person room order, know, put air
quotes, "To Alpha person," giving money. act
altruistic benevolent philanthropy. not act aggression. course, don't
know people feeling underneath that. Again, can't anthropomorphize
project onto people feeling. point testosterone
not make people aggressive. experiments talking
now, actually activation estrogen receptor containing neurons
makes animals aggressive. turns evidence
certain context, estrogen can make people aggressive. going here?
Well, going testosterone can converted estrogen
process called aromatization. enzyme called aromatase. Anytime
word ends A-S-E, least context biology, almost always not
always, almost always enzyme. aromatase enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen, actually testosterone, aromatized, converted estrogen
binding estrogen containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
triggers aggression. want repeat that, not testosterone itself, triggers
aggression. testosterone aromatized estrogen within brain binding
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
evokes aggression dramatic aggression that. Now effect estrogen causing
aggression brain robust, much take mouse lacks
aromatase enzyme human lacks aromatase enzyme, exist,
reduction overall aggression, despite high levels testosterone.
people mice aromatase enzyme enzyme blocked, well,
doesn't matter much increase testosterone derivatives.
not observe aggression. runs counter everything know
think role testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.
can increase desire work challenge. said before, ran
pressure tested Robert Sapolsky working testosterone


role brain behavior many decades now. fair say testosterone
net effect making effort feel good, least increasing threshold
effort feels bad unsustainable. way changing activity
threshold activation brain structures, like amygdala brain structures
associated anxiety. next time somebody says, testosterone makes people
aggressive. can say, "Ah, no, actually estrogen makes people aggressive,
animals aggressive matter. Now course case males
relatively less estrogen circulating brain body females, right?
testes, not ovaries, testosterone required first place
order converted estrogen, activate aggressive circuit involving
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus.
nonetheless, estrogen final step. hormone aggression
hinges. think people, quite surprising finding. yet
perhaps one robust findings animal human literature,
relates hormones psychological states behavior. Now, course case
testosterone low, person animal will exhibit less aggressive
behavior, not reduced testosterone per se.
subsequent reduction testosterone,

00:43:00 Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression

meaning no testosterone aromatize estrogen, estrogen will also
lower. established not testosterone, testosterone converted
estrogen activates circuits aggression. nonetheless, still surprising,
right? mean, us don't think estrogen hormone stimulates
aggression, turns contextual. beautiful data showing
whether not estrogen stimulates aggression, can powerfully modulated whether
not days short days long. words, whether not lot
sunshine not. Now, obviously brain encased skull. doesn't really know
lot sunshine even though can see sun eyes,
can feel skin. Day length converted hormonal signals chemical
signals primary hormonal chemical signals involve melatonin dopamine
also stress hormones. make long story short, long days
get lot sunlight, eyes skin, melatonin levels


reduced. Melatonin hormone tends produce states sleepiness
quiescence. also tends activate pathways tend reduce things like breeding
sexual behavior. long days, dopamine increased. Dopamine molecule
associated feelings wellbeing motivation desire seek sorts
things, sorts motivated behaviors. long days provided getting
enough sunlight skin eyes, stress hormones, especially cortisol,
stress hormones reduced levels. estrogen levels
increased experimentally long day conditions, not evoke aggression.
However, short days, estrogen increased, heightened predisposition
aggression. makes perfect sense. think short days
biology brain body. short days, melatonin signal goes up.
melatonin circulating 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones
circulating more. Why? Short days tend associated winter. winter,
bombarded bacterial viruses bacterial viruses actually survive better
cold heat. fact, laboratory, work lot viruses
bacteria want keep alive, put freezer. want
kill them, want inoculate them, put UV light. Like see
sunlight. shorter days conducive aggression. Not days
short per se,

00:45:46 Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors

stress hormone levels higher dopamine levels lower.
Now, starts converge clear biological picture,
clear psychological picture, indeed clear set tools can think
use. conditions cortisol high, stress hormone elevated
conditions neuromodulator serotonin reduced greater
propensity estrogen trigger aggression. Now, again, know said before,
males make lot testosterone relative estrogen, swap
mind idea testosterone high, means estrogen low
can true periphery body, testosterone high, going
aromatization, conversion testosterone estrogen. anytime hear
testosterone high, think testosterone high body perhaps
estrogen low body. means going heightened levels


estrogen brain therefore increased propensity aggression. females
generally make less testosterone relative estrogen, sufficient estrogen already
present trigger aggression. males females primed aggression,
riding context context whether not get tendency
aggression not. depends whether not cortisol high low, telling
cortisol relatively higher individual, going tilt, increase
hydraulic pressure Lorenz talked toward aggression. serotonin,
neuromodulator associated feelings wellbeing sometimes even
slight passivity, certainly wellbeing, serotonin low, also going
shift towards aggressive tendency. return Lorenz's hydraulic
pressure model aggression internal states, realize external stimuli,
things hear, things see, instance, someone saying something
upsetting us, seeing somebody something don't like others us,
well internal state, subjective feelings wellbeing, also stress level,
feelings whether not enough resources content
have. converging thing call internal state creating
pressure either aggressive less aggressive. now
major players feeding final pathway. question whether not will hit
other, person, will say thing considered aggressive? Will not say it?
somebody says something something aggressive us, will respond will
submissive even passive? Again, many things funneling
question dictating whether not answer is, "Absolutely fight back," or, "I'm
going attack even unprovoked." say this, going that, no
matter do, not going respond. kinds things complex.
yet really can boil just common elements. telling
elements whether not cortisol levels relatively lower relatively
higher. Again, relatively higher going tend make people reactive. Why?
reactivity really function autonomic nervous system, sort
like seesaw oscillates so-called sympathetic arm autonomic
nervous system, tends put us state readiness release
adrenaline. Cortisol adrenaline circulating brain body, make us
likely move react speak. actually will induce kind low
level tremor, anticipatory tremor able move quickly, right?
body motion easily set motion, is, neuromodulator


serotonin neuromodulator general associated feelings wellbeing
response already have. well fed, serotonin tends
released brain body, particular, well fed carbohydrates, precursor
serotonin tryptophan. indeed nice studies exploring types diets,
nutritional programs can reduce aggressive behavior, children adults
tryptophan-rich diets supplementation tryptophan. tryptophan rich
diets, things like white turkey meat, also number carbohydrates
can look up. easy find foods contain lots tryptophan. foods
contain precursor serotonin. Now isn't simply case eating foods
tryptophan will tend reduce aggression. suppose that, ate
abundance, make tired less likely aggressive,
don't recommend strategy, idea explored,
increasing levels tryptophan either supplementation food drugs,
prescription drugs increase serotonin. instance, fluoxetine sometimes called
Prozac Zoloft number SSRIs tend reduce aggressive behavior.
Now, not always, general, case. Similarly, elevated cortisol
tends shift whole system, again, create hydraulic pressure towards
aggressive states. cortisol levels reduced, well tendency aggressive
behavior reduced. supported number peer reviewed studies.

systems changing overall tone propensity neurons
ventromedial hypothalamus activated. much omega 3 fatty acid, source?
Well, talked podcast before. can, course get omega 3
fatty acids number different foods. Getting whole foods probably
best way it, many people, including people depression will often
supplement one gram omega 3 fatty acid per day. people
including will take every day just general mood enhancer. don't suffer
depression, found beneficial health. people
that, talked before, double blind placebo controlled studies, people
taking one three grams omega 3 fatty acids per day, typically form high
quality fish oil, although sources well, algae forth, can
experience improvements mood par SSRIs, selective

00:54:18 Tool: Sunlight, Sauna & Cortisol Reduction

take lower doses SSRIs still keep mood place beneficial
them. terms keeping cortisol range healthy doesn't bias
someone toward high levels aggression irritability, again, going set
number larger modulators contextual cues. talked
podcast, just briefly recap now, obviously getting sunlight eyes
early day, much sunlight safely can eyes throughout day
going important. Again, effect estrogen long days, not
increasing aggression, however, shorter days, estrogen increases aggression


increase cortisol observed short days. Another way reduce
cortisol discussed episode heat use sauna heat, also
hot baths. turns hot baths sauna can beneficial reducing
cortisol. details included episode heat timestamped,
can go directly want learn temperatures various
durations, just give synopsis that, 20 minute sauna anywhere 80
hundred degrees Celsius going beneficial reducing cortisol. don't
access sauna, hot bath, adjust temperature don't
burn yourself. think 80 hundred degrees Celsius going hot many
people hot bath, whereas many people can't tolerate hot bath can
tolerate sauna. safety first always, course,

00:55:54 Tool: Ashwagandha & Cortisol Reduction

hot baths reduce cortisol, hot saunas, reduce cortisol duration 20 30
minutes going beneficial. course, may interested
exploring supplementation route reductions cortisol, really chief player
ashwagandha, known decrease cortisol, fairly potently. just
warn going use ashwagandha order reduce cortisol, first all,
check doctor healthcare provider adding subtracting anything

amount neurotransmitter hormone receptors enzymes, et cetera, shift
activity biology particular direction. bias biology. fact,
genetic variant present certain people adjusts estrogen receptor sensitivity,
estrogen receptor sensitivity can result increased levels aggression,
sometimes dramatic increases, however, also interestingly, photo period,
meaning day length, strong modulator whether not aggressiveness turns
not. Whether not person particular gene variant aggressive
not, depends long day long night is. One particular study
like references Trainer, et al, title study "Photo period

Sciences. put reference show notes, like explore further,
really points fact rarely, sometimes, rarely, case just one
gene will cause somebody hyper aggressive. Almost always going
interplay genetics environment environment changes day
length changes length night changes, too, will tendency people
given genetic variant aggressive not. Now, course, absence
detailed genetic testing particular estrogen receptor variant, people,
guessing you, probably not walking around knowing gene not.
Regardless, think important pay attention feel different times

perhaps feeling aggressive. careful


drawing one-to-one relationship biological feature certainly
psychological behavioral feature like aggressiveness, it's, believe, helpful

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain

alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm

01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression

tendency impulsivity alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
different mechanism. really interesting study, just mention title
study is, "Caffeinated non-caffeinated alcohol use indirect aggression

forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,

terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,

Lorenz referring to, really underlying biological basis. Now
years later first experiments came along, really started
identify brain areas biological so-called pressures can induce
aggressive behavior. person really gets credit guy name
Walter Hess, time working cats. know say working
cats, lot people will cringe. lot people cats pets, certainly cats
can delightful. people like more, people like less. people
cringe idea experiments cats. say days,
laboratories work cats. laboratories work animal models will work

even aggression you, can do, however, look data make

also humans confirm indeed, stimulation brain area evoked not just
behavioral aggression, also subjective feelings aggression anger.
incredible brain area, rather, say, brain area
harbored incredible capacity generate aggressive behavior Hess's
experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural
circuits, oftentimes center back amygdala prefrontal cortex,
names will come up. haven't heard before, don't worry,
make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000
neurons so, not exactly 3000, 3000 neurons sufficient generate
aggressive behavior sort Hess observed cat, believe not,
see somebody act rage act verbal aggression act
defensive aggression, protecting family loved ones country, et cetera,
almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments
done just recently within last 10 years so, leading right year
even last month keep confirming again,


activity neurons ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,

00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts Aggression, Biting

male mouse female mouse evokes dramatic, almost instantaneous
aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done
Dayu Lin laboratory laboratories shown ventromedial
hypothalamus connected bunch brain areas interesting,
talk little bit, one want call now
so-called PAG, periaqueductal gray nucleus. large structure back
brain houses things like neurons can create opioids. know
opioid crisis, neurons can produce endogenous, means made


body, chemicals can cause pain relief. understand might occur
circuit aggression, right? Even one aggressor, likely may
incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing
stations, excuse me, arrive things like jaws. fact, stimulation
ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially
human children, biting something that, young children might form
aggression, tends disappear pretty early childhood. doesn't, often seen
mark pathology. story this, actually, kid, went
summer sports camp never forget this, playing soccer rare
stroke luck accident, happened score goal. wasn't particularly good soccer
player, especially not stage life. later figured just better
make fullback, 'cause just wait fullbacks do.
better taking ball person putting ball goal.
Nonetheless, I, again, chance, scored goal trotting back side
field, sudden felt sting back, kid, not named, although
remember name, not going tell name was. kid jumped
back bit top back. course resulted discussion
timeout usual things parents think got involved. don't recall, didn't
think much else it, recall considered especially troubling behavior
bit opposed hit shoved something sort,
seem tendency use biting aggressive behavior associated
primitive circuitry. Now truly anthropomorphizing. don't know
kid happened thinking feeling time, I? certainly
not going say biting every case reflects pathology, although think
general agreement psychology community, psychiatric community
past certain age, using one's teeth impart aggression damage others
particularly primitive troubling least observer person
experiencing pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab shown activation
ventromedial hypothalamus triggers downstream circuit periaqueductal gray
triggers whole set circuits fixed action patterns.
back Lorenz fixed action patterns, including swinging limbs, right punching.
wouldn't necessarily controlled punching, also biting behavior.


remarkable me, least circuits brain can evoke violent use

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain

alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,

fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum

caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never

forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging

incredible brain area, rather, say, brain area
harbored incredible capacity generate aggressive behavior Hess's
experiments? Well, regular listeners podcast,
probably relieved know today going talk new neural
circuits, oftentimes center back amygdala prefrontal cortex,
names will come up. haven't heard before, don't worry,
make clear brain areas do. today going
talk lot so-called VMH ventromedial hypothalamus. ventromedial
hypothalamus nucleus, meaning small collection neurons... neurons?
Nerve cells, small collection neurons call ventromedial
hypothalamus truly small. 1,500 neurons one side brain
matching 1,500 neurons side brain combined 3000
neurons so, not exactly 3000, 3000 neurons sufficient generate
aggressive behavior sort Hess observed cat, believe not,
see somebody act rage act verbal aggression act
defensive aggression, protecting family loved ones country, et cetera,
almost certainly neurons engaged behavior. neurons
perhaps even generating behavior. next describe experiments
done just recently within last 10 years so, leading right year
even last month keep confirming again,

sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,
ventromedial hypothalamus mouse, pretty straightforward
sort known started experiments. analyzed
genes, meaning DNA, course becomes RNA RNA becomes protein,
DNA therefore proteins expressed particular cells

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain

release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend

shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation

paraphrasing, "Here, given twice daily, carnitine appeared effective well

total problem score well-established measure behavioral problems kids

intentional problems, overall reductions delinquency, important sake
today's discussion, significant reductions aggressive behavior. Now especially


nice study, think, even though relatively small number subjects

activity neurons ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient generate full catalog aggressive behaviors. Now, go
describe beautiful recent studies VMH, ventromedial hypothalamus,
important role testosterone, importantly, estrogen, activation
aggressive behavior, right.

00:22:14 Psychiatric Disorders & Aggression

soon clear case. want emphasize
ventromedial hypothalamus something care about. Why? Well,
turns many categories psychiatric disorders, developmental disorders,
psychological challenges, things like schizophrenia, PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder, depression, borderline personality disorder, even certain forms autism
can include elements aggression even violence. Now certainly not case
aggression violence present people suffer schizophrenia
PTSD depression autism borderline personality disorder. absolutely not
saying that. However, can feature those. well described feature
terms trying understand constellation challenges people suffer
those. thinking VMH goes way beyond just understanding
basic aggression context adaptive aggression. So, know, earlier use
example, maternal aggression, one adaptive form aggression. also can
pathologic aggression, meaning can harm others. keep mind
go forward, later going talk specific tools designed
modulate prevent aggression in, instance,

00:23:36 Stimulation VMH, Estrogen Receptors & Aggression

people attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, especially kids ADHD.
meantime, return VMH, relatively small collection neurons.
reason say relatively small is, well, brain many hundreds billions
neurons, maybe even trillions neurons, exact number neurons isn't really clear,
lot. certainly lot relative number neurons 3000
neurons living hypothalamus can evoke aggressive response.
Experiments done David Anderson's lab Caltech really first parse


fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary
sufficient aggressive behavior. important experiments
worth knowing about. identified, first all,
ventromedial hypothalamus mouse, pretty straightforward
sort known started experiments. analyzed
genes, meaning DNA, course becomes RNA RNA becomes protein,
DNA therefore proteins expressed particular cells

00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts Aggression, Biting

male mouse female mouse evokes dramatic, almost instantaneous
aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done
Dayu Lin laboratory laboratories shown ventromedial
hypothalamus connected bunch brain areas interesting,
talk little bit, one want call now
so-called PAG, periaqueductal gray nucleus. large structure back
brain houses things like neurons can create opioids. know
opioid crisis, neurons can produce endogenous, means made


body, chemicals can cause pain relief. understand might occur
circuit aggression, right? Even one aggressor, likely may
incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing
stations, excuse me, arrive things like jaws. fact, stimulation
ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially
human children, biting something that, young children might form
aggression, tends disappear pretty early childhood. doesn't, often seen
mark pathology. story this, actually, kid, went
summer sports camp never forget this, playing soccer rare
stroke luck accident, happened score goal. wasn't particularly good soccer
player, especially not stage life. later figured just better
make fullback, 'cause just wait fullbacks do.
better taking ball person putting ball goal.
Nonetheless, I, again, chance, scored goal trotting back side
field, sudden felt sting back, kid, not named, although
remember name, not going tell name was. kid jumped
back bit top back. course resulted discussion
timeout usual things parents think got involved. don't recall, didn't
think much else it, recall considered especially troubling behavior
bit opposed hit shoved something sort,
seem tendency use biting aggressive behavior associated
primitive circuitry. Now truly anthropomorphizing. don't know
kid happened thinking feeling time, I? certainly
not going say biting every case reflects pathology, although think
general agreement psychology community, psychiatric community
past certain age, using one's teeth impart aggression damage others
particularly primitive troubling least observer person
experiencing pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab shown activation
ventromedial hypothalamus triggers downstream circuit periaqueductal gray
triggers whole set circuits fixed action patterns.
back Lorenz fixed action patterns, including swinging limbs, right punching.
wouldn't necessarily controlled punching, also biting behavior.


remarkable me, least circuits brain can evoke violent use
things like mouth violent use things like limbs. course used
things like singing kissing eating or, know, gesticulating kind polite
impolite way. point neural circuits,

00:35:56 Testosterone & Competitiveness/Estrogen & Aggression

not individual brain areas evoke constellation behaviors call aggression.
Now, many probably puzzled least talking
highly specialized brain area, ventromedial hypothalamus highly
specialized subcategory neurons ventromedial hypothalamus, neurons
make estrogen receptors. yet activation cells triggers dramatic
immediate aggression, males females males
females. going here? us think estrogen don't
immediately think aggression. us hear testosterone might think
aggression, although things well. order understand this, just want
briefly refer back conversation previous episode Huberman
Lab Podcast. colleague, great Robert Sapolsky course,
professor Stanford studied testosterone impacts behavior well
estrogen hormones impacts behavior. make long story short
dispel still unfortunately common myth. Testosterone not increase
aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity willingness lean effort
competitive scenarios. Sometimes referred challenge hypothesis,
make long story short, people given testosterone, look people
different levels, excuse me, testosterone, endogenously naturally
make. find testosterone tends increase competitiveness, not just
aggressive scenarios. somebody already aggressive, giving testosterone
will tendency make aggressive. somebody however
benevolent altruistic, giving testosterone will make benevolent
altruistic, least point. Now, course certain forms synthetic
testosterones known sports circles circles increase
aggressiveness way particular forms synthetic testosterones
work. general, experiments referring not done
using those, done using call traditional biological


forms testosterone resemble biological forms testosterone. fact,
Robert Sapolsky described really interesting experiment which, look
testosterone levels administer additional testosterone people

organizations good. find increased
testosterone increasing testosterone makes people willing compete,
give money person room order, know, put air
quotes, "To Alpha person," giving money. act
altruistic benevolent philanthropy. not act aggression. course, don't
know people feeling underneath that. Again, can't anthropomorphize
project onto people feeling. point testosterone
not make people aggressive. experiments talking
now, actually activation estrogen receptor containing neurons
makes animals aggressive. turns evidence
certain context, estrogen can make people aggressive. going here?
Well, going testosterone can converted estrogen
process called aromatization. enzyme called aromatase. Anytime
word ends A-S-E, least context biology, almost always not
always, almost always enzyme. aromatase enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen, actually testosterone, aromatized, converted estrogen
binding estrogen containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
triggers aggression. want repeat that, not testosterone itself, triggers
aggression. testosterone aromatized estrogen within brain binding
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
evokes aggression dramatic aggression that. Now effect estrogen causing
aggression brain robust, much take mouse lacks
aromatase enzyme human lacks aromatase enzyme, exist,
reduction overall aggression, despite high levels testosterone.
people mice aromatase enzyme enzyme blocked, well,
doesn't matter much increase testosterone derivatives.
not observe aggression. runs counter everything know
think role testosterone. Again, testosterone increases competitiveness.

animals aggressive matter. Now course case males
relatively less estrogen circulating brain body females, right?
testes, not ovaries, testosterone required first place
order converted estrogen, activate aggressive circuit involving
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus.
nonetheless, estrogen final step. hormone aggression
hinges. think people, quite surprising finding. yet
perhaps one robust findings animal human literature,
relates hormones psychological states behavior. Now, course case
testosterone low, person animal will exhibit less aggressive
behavior, not reduced testosterone per se.
subsequent reduction testosterone,

00:43:00 Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression

meaning no testosterone aromatize estrogen, estrogen will also
lower. established not testosterone, testosterone converted
estrogen activates circuits aggression. nonetheless, still surprising,
right? mean, us don't think estrogen hormone stimulates
aggression, turns contextual. beautiful data showing
whether not estrogen stimulates aggression, can powerfully modulated whether
not days short days long. words, whether not lot
sunshine not. Now, obviously brain encased skull. doesn't really know
lot sunshine even though can see sun eyes,
can feel skin. Day length converted hormonal signals chemical

quiescence. also tends activate pathways tend reduce things like breeding
sexual behavior. long days, dopamine increased. Dopamine molecule
associated feelings wellbeing motivation desire seek sorts
things, sorts motivated behaviors. long days provided getting
enough sunlight skin eyes, stress hormones, especially cortisol,
stress hormones reduced levels. estrogen levels
increased experimentally long day conditions, not evoke aggression.
However, short days, estrogen increased, heightened predisposition
aggression. makes perfect sense. think short days

melatonin circulating 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones
circulating more. Why? Short days tend associated winter. winter,

00:45:46 Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors

stress hormone levels higher dopamine levels lower.
Now, starts converge clear biological picture,
clear psychological picture, indeed clear set tools can think

cortisol relatively higher individual, going tilt, increase

neuromodulator associated feelings wellbeing sometimes even
slight passivity, certainly wellbeing, serotonin low, also going
shift towards aggressive tendency. return Lorenz's hydraulic

pressure either aggressive less aggressive. now
major players feeding final pathway. question whether not will hit

somebody says something something aggressive us, will respond will
submissive even passive? Again, many things funneling
question dictating whether not answer is, "Absolutely fight back," or, "I'm
going attack even unprovoked." say this, going that, no
matter do, not going respond. kinds things complex.
yet really can boil just common elements. telling
elements whether not cortisol levels relatively lower relatively

nutritional programs can reduce aggressive behavior, children adults
tryptophan-rich diets supplementation tryptophan. tryptophan rich
diets, things like white turkey meat, also number carbohydrates
can look up. easy find foods contain lots tryptophan. foods
contain precursor serotonin. Now isn't simply case eating foods
tryptophan will tend reduce aggression. suppose that, ate
abundance, make tired less likely aggressive,
don't recommend strategy, idea explored,
increasing levels tryptophan either supplementation food drugs,
prescription drugs increase serotonin. instance, fluoxetine sometimes called
Prozac Zoloft number SSRIs tend reduce aggressive behavior.
Now, not always, general, case. Similarly, elevated cortisol

short term. just going detail studies think
interesting important. First all, study explored levels
testosterone men different professions. Now, tell data, want
clear here, study this, one never knows whether not men
went particular profession testosterone level given value
whether not work altered testosterone levels both. think
fair assume probably both. careful assuming given
testosterone level causal choosing particular career particular career
causal creating particular testosterone level. study used salivary testosterone
levels measure, fair not best way measure testosterone.
Typically blood draw best way measure testosterone, nonetheless,
provided appropriate methods used, salivary testosterone can reasonable
measure testosterone. different occupations looked were,
just looked men particular study ministers, salesmen, didn't say
particular types salesmen, firemen, professors, things, physicians NFL
players. discovered testosterone levels essentially
order low highest. minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL
player. Now micro dissect different stereotypes different

firemen happened, least study lower testosterone levels average
professors physicians firemen lower testosterone
levels much stressful job cortisol levels
higher professor physician cortisol testosterone, not always,
generally somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode derive
precursor, et cetera. Typically, cortisol high, testosterone tends
lower vice versa. don't know causing effects. again,
just one study just six occupations, think relatively interesting given fact
professions involves different levels competitiveness, right?
don't necessarily just want think level physical exertion required,
also level competitiveness known competitive interactions
can cause increases testosterone, particular, winners competitive
interactions, topic future podcast. Meanwhile, studies analyzed also
again, salivary testosterone prisoners, case, female prisoners,
incarcerated individuals, looked levels testosterone according whether
not person committed non-violent violent crime order arrive prison.
higher levels salivary testosterone related arrived prison
conviction violent crime, opposed nonviolent crime. Likewise,
analyzed prison rule violations, indirect measure aggressiveness,
case, strongly associated aggressiveness knew
violations were, found prisoners none, no prison violations, prison
rule violations say, testosterone levels tended lower
testosterone levels women some, even one, aggressive violations
prison rules. provide links studies show notes like go
further, obviously studies like need taken grain salt
many different factors, different prisons different degrees

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain

alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can

alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing

01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression

tendency impulsivity alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
different mechanism. really interesting study, just mention title
study is, "Caffeinated non-caffeinated alcohol use indirect aggression

others otherwise, somehow trying reduce wellbeing others saying certain
things particular groups, study examined males females.
done way college campus study, subjects 18 47 years old. guess
older students campus, maybe use non-students,
know, days also got students thirties forties.
fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum
people different backgrounds. looked particular people ingested non-
caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never
really liked drugs alcohol sort fortunate way can drink not drink

people might actually typical. others drinking least one
caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. individuals end high, say
7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. energy drinks
combined, typically hard alcohol, fairly commonly available bars
forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,

fine circuitry really show ventromedial hypothalamus necessary

worth knowing about. identified, first all,
ventromedial hypothalamus mouse, pretty straightforward

00:31:57 Neural Circuits Mediating Physical Acts Aggression, Biting

male mouse female mouse evokes dramatic, almost instantaneous
aggressive behavior, physically aggressive behavior. Subsequent experiments done
Dayu Lin laboratory laboratories shown ventromedial
hypothalamus connected bunch brain areas interesting,
talk little bit, one want call now
so-called PAG, periaqueductal gray nucleus. large structure back
brain houses things like neurons can create opioids. know
opioid crisis, neurons can produce endogenous, means made


body, chemicals can cause pain relief. understand might occur
circuit aggression, right? Even one aggressor, likely may
incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing
stations, excuse me, arrive things like jaws. fact, stimulation
ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially
human children, biting something that, young children might form
aggression, tends disappear pretty early childhood. doesn't, often seen
mark pathology. story this, actually, kid, went
summer sports camp never forget this, playing soccer rare
stroke luck accident, happened score goal. wasn't particularly good soccer
player, especially not stage life. later figured just better

Nonetheless, I, again, chance, scored goal trotting back side

timeout usual things parents think got involved. don't recall, didn't
think much else it, recall considered especially troubling behavior
bit opposed hit shoved something sort,
seem tendency use biting aggressive behavior associated
primitive circuitry. Now truly anthropomorphizing. don't know
kid happened thinking feeling time, I? certainly
not going say biting every case reflects pathology, although think
general agreement psychology community, psychiatric community
past certain age, using one's teeth impart aggression damage others
particularly primitive troubling least observer person
experiencing pretty disturbing event. Dayu's lab shown activation
ventromedial hypothalamus triggers downstream circuit periaqueductal gray

back Lorenz fixed action patterns, including swinging limbs, right punching.
wouldn't necessarily controlled punching, also biting behavior.


remarkable me, least circuits brain can evoke violent use

Now, many probably puzzled least talking

briefly refer back conversation previous episode Huberman
Lab Podcast. colleague, great Robert Sapolsky course,
professor Stanford studied testosterone impacts behavior well
estrogen hormones impacts behavior. make long story short
dispel still unfortunately common myth. Testosterone not increase
aggressiveness, testosterone increases proactivity willingness lean effort
competitive scenarios. Sometimes referred challenge hypothesis,
make long story short, people given testosterone, look people
different levels, excuse me, testosterone, endogenously naturally
make. find testosterone tends increase competitiveness, not just
aggressive scenarios. somebody already aggressive, giving testosterone
will tendency make aggressive. somebody however

Robert Sapolsky described really interesting experiment which, look

know people feeling underneath that. Again, can't anthropomorphize
project onto people feeling. point testosterone
not make people aggressive. experiments talking
now, actually activation estrogen receptor containing neurons
makes animals aggressive. turns evidence
certain context, estrogen can make people aggressive. going here?
Well, going testosterone can converted estrogen

word ends A-S-E, least context biology, almost always not
always, almost always enzyme. aromatase enzyme converts testosterone
estrogen, actually testosterone, aromatized, converted estrogen

aggression. testosterone aromatized estrogen within brain binding
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus
evokes aggression dramatic aggression that. Now effect estrogen causing

reduction overall aggression, despite high levels testosterone.
people mice aromatase enzyme enzyme blocked, well,
doesn't matter much increase testosterone derivatives.

testes, not ovaries, testosterone required first place
order converted estrogen, activate aggressive circuit involving
estrogen receptor containing neurons ventromedial hypothalamus.
nonetheless, estrogen final step. hormone aggression

perhaps one robust findings animal human literature,
relates hormones psychological states behavior. Now, course case
testosterone low, person animal will exhibit less aggressive
behavior, not reduced testosterone per se.
subsequent reduction testosterone,

00:43:00 Sunlight, Melatonin & Aggression

meaning no testosterone aromatize estrogen, estrogen will also
lower. established not testosterone, testosterone converted
estrogen activates circuits aggression. nonetheless, still surprising,
right? mean, us don't think estrogen hormone stimulates
aggression, turns contextual. beautiful data showing
whether not estrogen stimulates aggression, can powerfully modulated whether
not days short days long. words, whether not lot
sunshine not. Now, obviously brain encased skull. doesn't really know
lot sunshine even though can see sun eyes,

quiescence. also tends activate pathways tend reduce things like breeding
sexual behavior. long days, dopamine increased. Dopamine molecule

things, sorts motivated behaviors. long days provided getting
enough sunlight skin eyes, stress hormones, especially cortisol,
stress hormones reduced levels. estrogen levels
increased experimentally long day conditions, not evoke aggression.
However, short days, estrogen increased, heightened predisposition
aggression. makes perfect sense. think short days
biology brain body. short days, melatonin signal goes up.
melatonin circulating 24 hour cycle. Stress hormones
circulating more. Why? Short days tend associated winter. winter,

00:45:46 Cortisol, Serotonin & Aggressive Behaviors

stress hormone levels higher dopamine levels lower.
Now, starts converge clear biological picture,
clear psychological picture, indeed clear set tools can think

males make lot testosterone relative estrogen, swap
mind idea testosterone high, means estrogen low

estrogen low body. means going heightened levels


estrogen brain therefore increased propensity aggression. females
generally make less testosterone relative estrogen, sufficient estrogen already

yet really can boil just common elements. telling

released brain body, particular, well fed carbohydrates, precursor

tryptophan-rich diets supplementation tryptophan. tryptophan rich
diets, things like white turkey meat, also number carbohydrates
can look up. easy find foods contain lots tryptophan. foods
contain precursor serotonin. Now isn't simply case eating foods
tryptophan will tend reduce aggression. suppose that, ate
abundance, make tired less likely aggressive,
don't recommend strategy, idea explored,
increasing levels tryptophan either supplementation food drugs,
prescription drugs increase serotonin. instance, fluoxetine sometimes called
Prozac Zoloft number SSRIs tend reduce aggressive behavior.
Now, not always, general, case. Similarly, elevated cortisol

aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis

release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing
arousal readiness,

01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression

tendency impulsivity alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
different mechanism. really interesting study, just mention title

others otherwise, somehow trying reduce wellbeing others saying certain
things particular groups, study examined males females.

older students campus, maybe use non-students,
know, days also got students thirties forties.
fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum
people different backgrounds. looked particular people ingested non-
caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never
really liked drugs alcohol sort fortunate way can drink not drink

people might actually typical. others drinking least one
caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. individuals end high, say
7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. energy drinks
combined, typically hard alcohol, fairly commonly available bars
forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,
alcohol tends sedative suppressive effect autonomic nervous system,

incur physical damage want pain relief. PAG also
connected number neural circuits eventually, several processing

ventromedial hypothalamus can evoke biting aggressive biting behavior. Now
aggressive biting behavior particularly interesting humans especially

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring

context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,

things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain

alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis

release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend

shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also

fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum

forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring

context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,

things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard

even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis

release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing

older students campus, maybe use non-students,
know, days also got students thirties forties.
fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum
people different backgrounds. looked particular people ingested non-
caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never

people might actually typical. others drinking least one
caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. individuals end high, say
7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. energy drinks

forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,

increase cortisol observed short days. Another way reduce
cortisol discussed episode heat use sauna heat, also
hot baths. turns hot baths sauna can beneficial reducing
cortisol. details included episode heat timestamped,
can go directly want learn temperatures various
durations, just give synopsis that, 20 minute sauna anywhere 80
hundred degrees Celsius going beneficial reducing cortisol. don't

helpful. light stuff cortisol estrogen day length,
mention fact, people genetic predisposition
irritable aggressive, couple different gene pathways
associated this. never like think just one gene causing specific

genetic variant present certain people adjusts estrogen receptor sensitivity,
estrogen receptor sensitivity can result increased levels aggression,
sometimes dramatic increases, however, also interestingly, photo period,

01:00:37 Testosterone & Aggression, Competitive Work Environments

regardless time year, regardless whether not happen
particular genetic variant. earlier talked testosterone converted
estrogen activating aggression ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone
itself. However, studies carried humans evaluated
effects testosterone levels testosterone correlate aggressiveness
short term. just going detail studies think
interesting important. First all, study explored levels
testosterone men different professions. Now, tell data, want
clear here, study this, one never knows whether not men
went particular profession testosterone level given value
whether not work altered testosterone levels both. think
fair assume probably both. careful assuming given
testosterone level causal choosing particular career particular career
causal creating particular testosterone level. study used salivary testosterone
levels measure, fair not best way measure testosterone.
Typically blood draw best way measure testosterone, nonetheless,
provided appropriate methods used, salivary testosterone can reasonable
measure testosterone. different occupations looked were,
just looked men particular study ministers, salesmen, didn't say
particular types salesmen, firemen, professors, things, physicians NFL
players. discovered testosterone levels essentially
order low highest. minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL
player. Now micro dissect different stereotypes different

firemen happened, least study lower testosterone levels average
professors physicians firemen lower testosterone
levels much stressful job cortisol levels
higher professor physician cortisol testosterone, not always,
generally somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode derive
precursor, et cetera. Typically, cortisol high, testosterone tends
lower vice versa. don't know causing effects. again,
just one study just six occupations, think relatively interesting given fact
professions involves different levels competitiveness, right?
don't necessarily just want think level physical exertion required,
also level competitiveness known competitive interactions
can cause increases testosterone, particular, winners competitive
interactions, topic future podcast. Meanwhile, studies analyzed also
again, salivary testosterone prisoners, case, female prisoners,
incarcerated individuals, looked levels testosterone according whether
not person committed non-violent violent crime order arrive prison.
higher levels salivary testosterone related arrived prison
conviction violent crime, opposed nonviolent crime. Likewise,
analyzed prison rule violations, indirect measure aggressiveness,
case, strongly associated aggressiveness knew
violations were, found prisoners none, no prison violations, prison
rule violations say, testosterone levels tended lower
testosterone levels women some, even one, aggressive violations
prison rules. provide links studies show notes like go
further, obviously studies like need taken grain salt
many different factors, different prisons different degrees

01:05:07 Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort

violence begin competitiveness begin with. just final pass
examining role testosterone aggressiveness,

lean effort. effort involves aggressive, either reactively aggressive
proactively aggressive,

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis
deploy bunch chemicals jut rest body, activate adrenaline


release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain
prefrontal cortex particular called top-down inhibition. exerts inhibitory
quieting effect circuits hypothalamus,
ventromedial hypothalamus. way conceptualize forebrain able

pathways telling you, "Don't say mean thing." "Don't violent thing," et cetera.
Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing
arousal readiness,

01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression

tendency impulsivity alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
different mechanism. really interesting study, just mention title
study is, "Caffeinated non-caffeinated alcohol use indirect aggression
impact self-regulation." title almost self-explanatory. paper
published Journal Addictive Behavior 2016, examining ingestion
alcohol either caffeinated non-decaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted
call indirect aggression. just remind indirect aggression is, not
physical acts aggression. verbal acts aggression, embarrassing


others otherwise, somehow trying reduce wellbeing others saying certain
things particular groups, study examined males females.
done way college campus study, subjects 18 47 years old. guess
older students campus, maybe use non-students,
know, days also got students thirties forties.
fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum
people different backgrounds. looked particular people ingested non-
caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never
really liked drugs alcohol sort fortunate way can drink not drink
tend not drink. me, 9.18, drinks per week sounds like lot, know
people might actually typical. others drinking least one
caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. individuals end high, say
7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. energy drinks
combined, typically hard alcohol, fairly commonly available bars
forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,
alcohol tends sedative suppressive effect autonomic nervous system,


least initial period, going tend reduce likelihood people will
engage type behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal
increase likelihood someone will engage particular type behavior,

forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,
alcohol tends sedative suppressive effect autonomic nervous system,

total problem score well-established measure behavioral problems kids

intentional problems, overall reductions delinquency, important sake
today's discussion, significant reductions aggressive behavior. Now especially


nice study, think, even though relatively small number subjects
certainly needs repeated studies laboratories,
able confirm shifts L-carnitine within bloodstream kids,
able correlate physiology psychological changes, studies like
this. frankly studies human pharmacology, worry effects
show up, not just placebo effects, so-called off target

still entirely possible, think studies increase confidence
things like L-carnitine can used perhaps concert things like omega 3

therefore serotonin,

01:24:10 Factors Affecting “Hydraulic Pressure Model” Aggression

obviously avoiding things like alcohol appears study just described,
reducing one's intake not consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages seems like
good idea goal reduce aggressiveness, think

avoiding light evening on. studies think useful
point fact seldom, ever, will one supplement
one nutritional change even one behavioral change, going completely shift
individual aggressive impulsive, rather combining different
behavioral regimens, paying attention things like time year work conditions
school conditions overall levels stress likely therefore levels cortisol, et
cetera, can use behaviors, diet, supplementation way shift

best way it, many people, including people depression will often
supplement one gram omega 3 fatty acid per day. people
including will take every day just general mood enhancer. don't suffer
depression, found beneficial health. people
that, talked before, double blind placebo controlled studies, people
taking one three grams omega 3 fatty acids per day, typically form high

increase cortisol observed short days. Another way reduce
cortisol discussed episode heat use sauna heat, also
hot baths. turns hot baths sauna can beneficial reducing
cortisol. details included episode heat timestamped,

genetic variant present certain people adjusts estrogen receptor sensitivity,
estrogen receptor sensitivity can result increased levels aggression,
sometimes dramatic increases, however, also interestingly, photo period,

01:00:37 Testosterone & Aggression, Competitive Work Environments

regardless time year, regardless whether not happen
particular genetic variant. earlier talked testosterone converted
estrogen activating aggression ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone
itself. However, studies carried humans evaluated
effects testosterone levels testosterone correlate aggressiveness
short term. just going detail studies think
interesting important. First all, study explored levels
testosterone men different professions. Now, tell data, want
clear here, study this, one never knows whether not men
went particular profession testosterone level given value
whether not work altered testosterone levels both. think
fair assume probably both. careful assuming given
testosterone level causal choosing particular career particular career
causal creating particular testosterone level. study used salivary testosterone
levels measure, fair not best way measure testosterone.
Typically blood draw best way measure testosterone, nonetheless,
provided appropriate methods used, salivary testosterone can reasonable
measure testosterone. different occupations looked were,
just looked men particular study ministers, salesmen, didn't say
particular types salesmen, firemen, professors, things, physicians NFL
players. discovered testosterone levels essentially
order low highest. minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL
player. Now micro dissect different stereotypes different
features jobs. instance, don't know whether not fact


firemen happened, least study lower testosterone levels average
professors physicians firemen lower testosterone
levels much stressful job cortisol levels
higher professor physician cortisol testosterone, not always,
generally somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode derive
precursor, et cetera. Typically, cortisol high, testosterone tends
lower vice versa. don't know causing effects. again,
just one study just six occupations, think relatively interesting given fact
professions involves different levels competitiveness, right?
don't necessarily just want think level physical exertion required,
also level competitiveness known competitive interactions
can cause increases testosterone, particular, winners competitive
interactions, topic future podcast. Meanwhile, studies analyzed also
again, salivary testosterone prisoners, case, female prisoners,
incarcerated individuals, looked levels testosterone according whether
not person committed non-violent violent crime order arrive prison.
higher levels salivary testosterone related arrived prison
conviction violent crime, opposed nonviolent crime. Likewise,
analyzed prison rule violations, indirect measure aggressiveness,
case, strongly associated aggressiveness knew
violations were, found prisoners none, no prison violations, prison
rule violations say, testosterone levels tended lower
testosterone levels women some, even one, aggressive violations
prison rules. provide links studies show notes like go
further, obviously studies like need taken grain salt
many different factors, different prisons different degrees

01:05:07 Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort

violence begin competitiveness begin with. just final pass
examining role testosterone aggressiveness,

effects pathways related aggression. think something not
often discussed many effects steroid hormones like testosterone,
estrogen slow acting. fact, steroid hormones, certain
biochemical composition can actually pass membranes cells,
outside cell nucleus cell change gene expression cell,
think puberty, kid goes home summer comes back
looking completely different. Well lot genes got turned
steroid hormones like testosterone estrogen, steroid hormones can also
fast acting effects testosterone particular, can remarkably
fast acting one apparent well documented fast acting effects
effect: ability activate cells within amygdala, might say, "Well, thought

Turns amygdala harbors, cortisol, corticosteroid receptors

testosterone tends activate amygdala circuitry inducing states mind

lean effort. effort involves aggressive, either reactively aggressive
proactively aggressive,

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,

things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm

regardless time year, regardless whether not happen
particular genetic variant. earlier talked testosterone converted
estrogen activating aggression ventromedial hypothalamus, not testosterone
itself. However, studies carried humans evaluated
effects testosterone levels testosterone correlate aggressiveness
short term. just going detail studies think
interesting important. First all, study explored levels
testosterone men different professions. Now, tell data, want
clear here, study this, one never knows whether not men
went particular profession testosterone level given value
whether not work altered testosterone levels both. think
fair assume probably both. careful assuming given
testosterone level causal choosing particular career particular career
causal creating particular testosterone level. study used salivary testosterone
levels measure, fair not best way measure testosterone.
Typically blood draw best way measure testosterone, nonetheless,
provided appropriate methods used, salivary testosterone can reasonable
measure testosterone. different occupations looked were,
just looked men particular study ministers, salesmen, didn't say
particular types salesmen, firemen, professors, things, physicians NFL
players. discovered testosterone levels essentially
order low highest. minister, salesman, fireman, professor, physician, NFL
player. Now micro dissect different stereotypes different

firemen happened, least study lower testosterone levels average

generally somewhat antagonistic push-pull mode derive

lower vice versa. don't know causing effects. again,
just one study just six occupations, think relatively interesting given fact
professions involves different levels competitiveness, right?
don't necessarily just want think level physical exertion required,
also level competitiveness known competitive interactions
can cause increases testosterone, particular, winners competitive
interactions, topic future podcast. Meanwhile, studies analyzed also
again, salivary testosterone prisoners, case, female prisoners,
incarcerated individuals, looked levels testosterone according whether
not person committed non-violent violent crime order arrive prison.
higher levels salivary testosterone related arrived prison
conviction violent crime, opposed nonviolent crime. Likewise,
analyzed prison rule violations, indirect measure aggressiveness,
case, strongly associated aggressiveness knew

01:05:07 Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort

violence begin competitiveness begin with. just final pass
examining role testosterone aggressiveness,
interesting study Goetz, et al, G-O-E-T-Z published 2014, looked serum,
case, blood levels testosterone. 30 minutes application gel-based
testosterone goes transdermal testosterone can go quickly

earlier, PAG. remarkable study showed just
30 minutes application so-called AndroGel, testosterone seeps

corticomedial amygdala activation. testosterone can acute effects, immediate
effects pathways related aggression. think something not
often discussed many effects steroid hormones like testosterone,
estrogen slow acting. fact, steroid hormones, certain
biochemical composition can actually pass membranes cells,
outside cell nucleus cell change gene expression cell,
think puberty, kid goes home summer comes back
looking completely different. Well lot genes got turned
steroid hormones like testosterone estrogen, steroid hormones can also
fast acting effects testosterone particular, can remarkably
fast acting one apparent well documented fast acting effects
effect: ability activate cells within amygdala, might say, "Well, thought
amygdala associated fear?" Wouldn't testosterone cause fear? No.
Turns amygdala harbors, cortisol, corticosteroid receptors
testosterone receptors, adjust activity amygdala differently,
testosterone tends activate amygdala circuitry inducing states mind
body action based indeed animals humans, testosterone
application activation corticomedial amygdala pathway will make animals
humans lean effort. say testosterone makes effort feel good, least

important points fact yes, estrogen activating aggression

beginning, middle end. Remember hydraulic pressure Conrad
Lorenz hypothesized? Well, think testosterone increasing pressure toward
aggressive episode estrogen actually triggering aggressive episode
ventromedial hypothalamus. somebody tells testosterone, endogenous
exogenous makes people aggressive, tell no, testosterone tends make people
lean effort. effort involves aggressive, either reactively aggressive
proactively aggressive,

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis
deploy bunch chemicals jut rest body, activate adrenaline


release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain
prefrontal cortex particular called top-down inhibition. exerts inhibitory
quieting effect circuits hypothalamus,
ventromedial hypothalamus. way conceptualize forebrain able
rationalize think clearly suppress behavior engage no-go
pathways telling you, "Don't say mean thing." "Don't violent thing," et cetera.
Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing
arousal readiness,

01:13:15 Tool: Caffeinated Alcohol Beverages, Impulsivity & Aggression

tendency impulsivity alcohol also increasing impulsivity,
different mechanism. really interesting study, just mention title
study is, "Caffeinated non-caffeinated alcohol use indirect aggression
impact self-regulation." title almost self-explanatory. paper
published Journal Addictive Behavior 2016, examining ingestion
alcohol either caffeinated non-decaffeinated alcohol drinks impacted
call indirect aggression. just remind indirect aggression is, not
physical acts aggression. verbal acts aggression, embarrassing


others otherwise, somehow trying reduce wellbeing others saying certain
things particular groups, study examined males females.
done way college campus study, subjects 18 47 years old. guess
older students campus, maybe use non-students,
know, days also got students thirties forties.
fairly broad swath subjects included, fairly broad racial background
well, included, not equal numbers, least included pretty broad spectrum
people different backgrounds. looked particular people ingested non-
caffeinated alcohol drinks frequency 9.18 drinks per week, okay. Again,
college campus, not encourage that. one people don't, never
really liked drugs alcohol sort fortunate way can drink not drink
tend not drink. me, 9.18, drinks per week sounds like lot, know
people might actually typical. others drinking least one
caffeinated alcoholic beverage per week. individuals end high, say
7.87 caffeinated alcohol beverages per week. energy drinks
combined, typically hard alcohol, fairly commonly available bars
forth. individuals drank much goodness, 20.36 alcoholic drinks per
week, total, caffeinated, not caffeinated. basic
outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,
alcohol tends sedative suppressive effect autonomic nervous system,


least initial period, going tend reduce likelihood people will
engage type behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal
increase likelihood someone will engage particular type behavior,
aggressive otherwise. combination caffeine alcohol really acting
two prong system bias people towards impulsivity less self-regulation.

total problem score well-established measure behavioral problems kids

today's discussion, significant reductions aggressive behavior. Now especially


nice study, think, even though relatively small number subjects

this. frankly studies human pharmacology, worry effects

still entirely possible, think studies increase confidence
things like L-carnitine can used perhaps concert things like omega 3

therefore serotonin,

01:24:10 Factors Affecting “Hydraulic Pressure Model” Aggression

obviously avoiding things like alcohol appears study just described,

cetera, can use behaviors, diet, supplementation way shift

just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard

regardless time year, regardless whether not happen
particular genetic variant. earlier talked testosterone converted

whether not work altered testosterone levels both. think
fair assume probably both. careful assuming given

causal creating particular testosterone level. study used salivary testosterone
levels measure, fair not best way measure testosterone.
Typically blood draw best way measure testosterone, nonetheless,
provided appropriate methods used, salivary testosterone can reasonable
measure testosterone. different occupations looked were,
just looked men particular study ministers, salesmen, didn't say
particular types salesmen, firemen, professors, things, physicians NFL
players. discovered testosterone levels essentially

just one study just six occupations, think relatively interesting given fact
professions involves different levels competitiveness, right?
don't necessarily just want think level physical exertion required,
also level competitiveness known competitive interactions
can cause increases testosterone, particular, winners competitive

again, salivary testosterone prisoners, case, female prisoners,
incarcerated individuals, looked levels testosterone according whether
not person committed non-violent violent crime order arrive prison.
higher levels salivary testosterone related arrived prison
conviction violent crime, opposed nonviolent crime. Likewise,
analyzed prison rule violations, indirect measure aggressiveness,
case, strongly associated aggressiveness knew

01:05:07 Testosterone, Amygdala, Challenge & Effort

violence begin competitiveness begin with. just final pass
examining role testosterone aggressiveness,
interesting study Goetz, et al, G-O-E-T-Z published 2014, looked serum,

30 minutes application so-called AndroGel, testosterone seeps

corticomedial amygdala activation. testosterone can acute effects, immediate

think puberty, kid goes home summer comes back
looking completely different. Well lot genes got turned
steroid hormones like testosterone estrogen, steroid hormones can also
fast acting effects testosterone particular, can remarkably
fast acting one apparent well documented fast acting effects
effect: ability activate cells within amygdala, might say, "Well, thought

Turns amygdala harbors, cortisol, corticosteroid receptors

testosterone tends activate amygdala circuitry inducing states mind

important points fact yes, estrogen activating aggression

ventromedial hypothalamus. somebody tells testosterone, endogenous
exogenous makes people aggressive, tell no, testosterone tends make people
lean effort. effort involves aggressive, either reactively aggressive
proactively aggressive,

01:09:27 Caffeine, Alcohol & Impulsivity

well will indeed lead aggression. actual aggression triggered
estrogen, not testosterone. Now, thus far, really haven't talked much
social context aggression occurs. near infinite,
not infinite number variables will determine that. instance, violent
aggression entirely appropriate professional boxing match provided occurring
inside ring competitors within bounds rules
sport, et cetera. However, things tend bias certain social
context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis
deploy bunch chemicals jut rest body, activate adrenaline


release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain

quieting effect circuits hypothalamus,
ventromedial hypothalamus. way conceptualize forebrain able

Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing
arousal readiness,

context toward aggressive less aggressive not always physical
aggression. generally come two forms many familiar with,
alcohol caffeine. discuss caffeine first. caffeine increase
aggressive impulsivity? Well, general effects caffeine increase autonomic
arousal. activity so-called sympathetic arm autonomic nervous system,
put much plain language alertness arm nervous
system. is, creates sense readiness brain body
activating so-called sympathetic chain ganglia. Again, always remind people,
simpa sympathetic not mean sympathy. Simpa means together,
ones. caffeine tends bias brain body activate sympathetic chain
ganglia, run base neck top pelvis
deploy bunch chemicals jut rest body, activate adrenaline


release. parallel increase adrenaline brain, creating state
alertness readiness. state alertness readiness can sorts
things, not just aggression. However state increased sympathetic
tone, meaning alert, drinking caffeine, will bias brain
body systems, hormones, chemicals, et cetera exist, toward action
opposed inaction. put simply, caffeine can increase impulsivity, no surprise there.
opposite end things, alcohol tends decrease activity sympathetic arm
autonomic nervous system, tends make us feel less alert. Now, initially can
create state alertness effects inhibiting forebrain, forebrain
prefrontal cortex particular called top-down inhibition. exerts inhibitory
quieting effect circuits hypothalamus,
ventromedial hypothalamus. way conceptualize forebrain able
rationalize think clearly suppress behavior engage no-go
pathways telling you, "Don't say mean thing." "Don't violent thing," et cetera.
Alcohol initially tends increase level overall activity reducing inhibition, not
just forebrain circuit, circuits. Tends make us active. tend
talk normally would, move normally would,
shortly thereafter starts acting sedative way reducing activity forebrain,
releasing deeper brain circuits involved impulsivity, also
causing somewhat sedative effect. course, alcohol levels increase even
further, people eventually will pass out, blackout, et cetera. got
alcohol caffeine got two opposite ends spectrum, caffeine increasing
arousal readiness,

outcome study alcohol someone tended consume,
likely engage indirect aggressive type behaviors.
terms caffeinated alcoholic beverages, there, effect especially interesting.
just going paraphrase actually read study, quote, "With regard
caffeinated alcoholic beverage use, findings indicated heavier caffeinated
alcohol beverage use associated positively indirect aggression, even
considering one's typical alcohol use dispositional aggression." means
even though alcohol can bias certain individuals aggressive, even
though certain individuals already disposition toward aggressive,
effect independent, meaning beyond alcohol
predisposition, meaning someone consuming caffeinated alcoholic beverages,
particularly high likelihood engaging indirect aggressive behavior. Now
makes perfect sense light model propose, self-regulation
model, basically self-regulation involves several things. involves engaging
certain behaviors suppressing behaviors. described before,
alcohol tends sedative suppressive effect autonomic nervous system,


least initial period, going tend reduce likelihood people will
engage type behavior. Whereas caffeine will increase autonomic arousal
increase likelihood someone will engage particular type behavior,

school conditions overall levels stress likely therefore levels cortisol, et
cetera, can use behaviors, diet, supplementation way shift
overall internal milieu one providing lot internal hydraulic pressure
