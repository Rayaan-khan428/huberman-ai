reasons caffeine makes us feel alert. much caffeine drink
drink caffeine turns vitally important adjusting wakefulness
optimizing sleep. talk well. category lever tools
immensely powerful optimizing sleep supplements. now exist
many eight different supplements can powerfully modulate sleep healthy ways
huge margins safety. going talk
supplements are. previous episodes podcast guest podcasts,
talked three particular supplements, magnesium threonate, apigenin,
theanine, together can really enhance speed one falls asleep
people's ability stay asleep really get deep stages sleep
particularly restorative. Today going talk little bit
three can best used combination, also going touch
supplements not talked much before, all. Things like


glycine GABA, well inositol. Many people going find inositol interesting
particular use them, especially following low-carbohydrate diet
fasting sleep just trying avoid eating close bedtime yet
hard time falling asleep. Inositol also turns especially useful
people tendency wake middle night hard time
falling back asleep. also interesting potent effects anxiety throughout

general categories levers tools optimizing sleep digital tools. Now,
say digital tools, don't necessarily mean devices. mean things like non-

00:15:10 Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol

can develop sleep toolkit ideal sleep needs. head
description tools optimizing sleep, consider perfect 24-hour
cycle look like. start 24-hour cycle wake
morning. you, will 5:00 a.m. others you, will 10:00
a.m. people, believe, wake sometime 6:30 a.m. 8:30 a.m.
regardless wake morning, one first things happens
body temperature increasing just going happen naturally.


going consequence moving around bit, really increase
body temperature one main triggers woke first place.
increase body temperature turn causes increase release
hormone called cortisol. Cortisol often discussed stress hormone, not just
associated stress. also enhances immune system provided cortisol
elevated right times, right time cortisol elevated first
wake morning. increase cortisol also going increase metabolism.
also going increase ability focus mentally move body.
again, cortisol often demonized consider bad thing. indeed, don't
want cortisol chronically consistently elevated throughout day night.
want cortisol reach peak early day right time wake up.
One way can ensure cortisol peak occurs early day right
time wake view bright light, ideally sunlight, within first 30
60 minutes waking. right, view bright sunlight within first 30 60 minutes
waking. get caveats happens wake

00:20:44 Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days

maybe 15 minutes, certainly within first hour waking. want share
three critical things tool morning sunlight viewing. First all,
not woo biology thing. grounded core physiology.
literally hundreds, not thousands, quality peer-reviewed papers showing light

four morning need awake, well, turn artificial lights.
sun out, however, sun risen, still want get outside
view sunlight. will wake sun comes out.
asking whether not turning artificial lights can replace sunlight hours,
unfortunately, answer no. Unless special light, talk
kind light, bright artificial lights home environment not, repeat,
not going sufficiently bright turn cortisol mechanism

called circadian, 24-hour clocks, mechanisms talking about.
wake sun still dark, please turn many bright
artificial lights possibly can need, get outside sun out.
cloudy days, especially need get outside. repeat, cloudy days, overcast days,

5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep

critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright

put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go

can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

optimizing sleep. talk well. category lever tools
immensely powerful optimizing sleep supplements. now exist
many eight different supplements can powerfully modulate sleep healthy ways
huge margins safety. going talk
supplements are. previous episodes podcast guest podcasts,
talked three particular supplements, magnesium threonate, apigenin,
theanine, together can really enhance speed one falls asleep
people's ability stay asleep really get deep stages sleep
particularly restorative. Today going talk little bit
three can best used combination, also going touch
supplements not talked much before, all. Things like


glycine GABA, well inositol. Many people going find inositol interesting
particular use them, especially following low-carbohydrate diet
fasting sleep just trying avoid eating close bedtime yet
hard time falling asleep. Inositol also turns especially useful
people tendency wake middle night hard time
falling back asleep. also interesting potent effects anxiety throughout

general categories levers tools optimizing sleep digital tools. Now,
say digital tools, don't necessarily mean devices. mean things like non-

really want provide many tools possible, give logic behind
tools best apply

00:15:10 Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol

can develop sleep toolkit ideal sleep needs. head
description tools optimizing sleep, consider perfect 24-hour
cycle look like. start 24-hour cycle wake
morning. you, will 5:00 a.m. others you, will 10:00
a.m. people, believe, wake sometime 6:30 a.m. 8:30 a.m.
regardless wake morning, one first things happens
body temperature increasing just going happen naturally.


going consequence moving around bit, really increase
body temperature one main triggers woke first place.
increase body temperature turn causes increase release
hormone called cortisol. Cortisol often discussed stress hormone, not just
associated stress. also enhances immune system provided cortisol
elevated right times, right time cortisol elevated first
wake morning. increase cortisol also going increase metabolism.
also going increase ability focus mentally move body.
again, cortisol often demonized consider bad thing. indeed, don't
want cortisol chronically consistently elevated throughout day night.
want cortisol reach peak early day right time wake up.
One way can ensure cortisol peak occurs early day right
time wake view bright light, ideally sunlight, within first 30
60 minutes waking. right, view bright sunlight within first 30 60 minutes
waking. get caveats happens wake
sun out, live UK no sun, people claim no
sun. Hate tell this, folks, sun UK. talk that.
everybody, whether not live cloudy place sunny place, whether not
cloud cover not day, really strive get bright light eyes,
ideally sunlight, within first 30 60 minutes waking. reason
simple. want trigger cortisol increase occur early day,
don't want cortisol peak happen later, will happen
wait get outside see sunlight. reason set
neurons, nerve cells, eye. called intrinsically photosensitive melanopsin
cells, not need know name. neurons respond best bright
light, especially right waking early day, best able signal
set neurons reside roof mouth called suprachiasmatic
nucleus, cluster neurons sends huge number signals,
electrical chemical, entire body triggers cortisol increase,
provides wake-up signal brain body, sets motion timer
fall asleep later night. again, not trying go much mechanism
today. trying really hammer tools substantiate tools just bit

00:20:44 Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days

maybe 15 minutes, certainly within first hour waking. want share
three critical things tool morning sunlight viewing. First all,
not woo biology thing. grounded core physiology.
literally hundreds, not thousands, quality peer-reviewed papers showing light
viewing early day powerful stimulus wakefulness throughout
day powerful, positive impact ability fall stay asleep night.
really foundational power tool ensuring great night's sleep


feeling awake day. Second all, wake sun out,
can, probably should, flip artificial lights internal home environment
apartment wherever happen live goal awake, right? wake
four morning need awake, well, turn artificial lights.
sun out, however, sun risen, still want get outside
view sunlight. will wake sun comes out.
asking whether not turning artificial lights can replace sunlight hours,
unfortunately, answer no. Unless special light, talk
kind light, bright artificial lights home environment not, repeat,
not going sufficiently bright turn cortisol mechanism
wake-up mechanisms need early day. diabolical twist, however,
lights home apartment even phone bright enough
disrupt sleep look late night middle night.
asymmetry retinal, eye biology, brain's biology, whereby
early day, right around waking, need lot light, lot photons, lot light
energy, artificial lights generally just won't accomplish need
accomplish. night, even little bit artificial light can really mess so-
called circadian, 24-hour clocks, mechanisms talking about.
wake sun still dark, please turn many bright
artificial lights possibly can need, get outside sun out.
cloudy days, especially need get outside. repeat, cloudy days, overcast days,
especially need get outside get sunlight. just need get it. Now,
much light much light viewing need? going vary
depending person place, literally live earth, whether not

sensitive eyes. really impossible give absolute prescriptive, can
give general guidelines. general, clear day, meaning no cloud cover
minimal cloud cover, want get sunlight exposure eyes five
minutes so. three minutes one day, seven minutes next day,
five minutes. day cloud cover, sun just peeking
clouds dense cloud cover, want get 10 minutes
sunlight exposure eyes early day. days really densely
overcast maybe even rainy, going want get much 20 30
minutes sunlight exposure. Another key thing not, forget about, just don't try


get sunlight exposure windshield car window, whether not

eyes morning sunlight sun will already moved low
solar angle overhead simply won't work sorts mechanisms related
circadian rhythm functions. just don't try windshield,
sunglasses, window. just not going work. Get outside. weather really
bad whatever reason, safety reasons, cannot get outside, well, suppose
try get near window. last, last resort. really want get

extremely dark overcast weather won't let outside live cave
small box not allow natural light whatever reason,
well, going need replacement sunlight. sunlight

general therefore suggest cheaper options work just well get
just bright. Things like ring lights sold order people take selfies
kind thing. drawing LED tablet will work pretty well. actually one
put desk morning even though still get outside look sunlight first
thing morning, again, also, especially, say, cloudy days. not

link couple different options want explore various options. don't
know people's different budgets are. don't know people live. just know
many listeners live locations throughout world where, instance,
winter, gets very, dark, can't get sufficient sunlight. get
morning light, ideally sunlight, take account specific points
given here. And, say, enjoy practice.

00:26:18 Evaluating Light Environment, Compensating Missed Morning Light

really nice get outside first thing morning get sunlight. fact,
start this, notice body will start feel energized will
feel energized quickly. actually start notice mechanism kicking
day, especially paying attention physiology. enjoy practice
getting outside. Yes, can take morning beverage outside. Yes, can take


dog you. fact, animals intuitively know get morning sunlight.
actually seek right times days. human beings need told
podcasters people science supports kinds practices.
pets apparently not. get outside alone somebody, kids,
dog. However go practice, make sure practice least
80% days life. right. miss day, instance,
bedridden day, try get next window. say traveling,
whatever reason, not able get outside first thing morning, well, try
get twice much sunlight eyes, say extend duration sunlight

that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating

delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy

throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning

Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag

morning. you, will 5:00 a.m. others you, will 10:00
a.m. people, believe, wake sometime 6:30 a.m. 8:30 a.m.
regardless wake morning, one first things happens
body temperature increasing just going happen naturally.


going consequence moving around bit, really increase
body temperature one main triggers woke first place.
increase body temperature turn causes increase release
hormone called cortisol. Cortisol often discussed stress hormone, not just
associated stress. also enhances immune system provided cortisol
elevated right times, right time cortisol elevated first
wake morning. increase cortisol also going increase metabolism.
also going increase ability focus mentally move body.
again, cortisol often demonized consider bad thing. indeed, don't
want cortisol chronically consistently elevated throughout day night.
want cortisol reach peak early day right time wake up.
One way can ensure cortisol peak occurs early day right
time wake view bright light, ideally sunlight, within first 30
60 minutes waking. right, view bright sunlight within first 30 60 minutes
waking. get caveats happens wake

00:20:44 Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days

maybe 15 minutes, certainly within first hour waking. want share
three critical things tool morning sunlight viewing. First all,
not woo biology thing. grounded core physiology.
literally hundreds, not thousands, quality peer-reviewed papers showing light

four morning need awake, well, turn artificial lights.
sun out, however, sun risen, still want get outside
view sunlight. will wake sun comes out.
asking whether not turning artificial lights can replace sunlight hours,
unfortunately, answer no. Unless special light, talk
kind light, bright artificial lights home environment not, repeat,
not going sufficiently bright turn cortisol mechanism
wake-up mechanisms need early day. diabolical twist, however,

called circadian, 24-hour clocks, mechanisms talking about.
wake sun still dark, please turn many bright
artificial lights possibly can need, get outside sun out.
cloudy days, especially need get outside. repeat, cloudy days, overcast days,
especially need get outside get sunlight. just need get it. Now,
much light much light viewing need? going vary

00:26:18 Evaluating Light Environment, Compensating Missed Morning Light

really nice get outside first thing morning get sunlight. fact,
start this, notice body will start feel energized will

that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating

throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit

say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body

second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag
episode specifically jet lag shift work. deep dive, go there,
suffice say now, going shift work, try stay
shift two weeks time. detrimental brain body, can even

caffeine. This, course, comes no surprise people, caffeine
works might come surprise. briefly, molecule body called
adenosine longer awake, adenosine builds

reasons caffeine makes us feel alert. much caffeine drink
drink caffeine turns vitally important adjusting wakefulness
optimizing sleep. talk well. category lever tools
immensely powerful optimizing sleep supplements. now exist
many eight different supplements can powerfully modulate sleep healthy ways
huge margins safety. going talk
supplements are. previous episodes podcast guest podcasts,
talked three particular supplements, magnesium threonate, apigenin,
theanine, together can really enhance speed one falls asleep
people's ability stay asleep really get deep stages sleep
particularly restorative. Today going talk little bit
three can best used combination, also going touch
supplements not talked much before, all. Things like


glycine GABA, well inositol. Many people going find inositol interesting
particular use them, especially following low-carbohydrate diet
fasting sleep just trying avoid eating close bedtime yet
hard time falling asleep. Inositol also turns especially useful
people tendency wake middle night hard time
falling back asleep. also interesting potent effects anxiety throughout
day. going talk inositol tool well. last list
general categories levers tools optimizing sleep digital tools. Now,
say digital tools, don't necessarily mean devices. mean things like non-

00:15:10 Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol

can develop sleep toolkit ideal sleep needs. head
description tools optimizing sleep, consider perfect 24-hour
cycle look like. start 24-hour cycle wake
morning. you, will 5:00 a.m. others you, will 10:00
a.m. people, believe, wake sometime 6:30 a.m. 8:30 a.m.
regardless wake morning, one first things happens
body temperature increasing just going happen naturally.


going consequence moving around bit, really increase
body temperature one main triggers woke first place.
increase body temperature turn causes increase release
hormone called cortisol. Cortisol often discussed stress hormone, not just
associated stress. also enhances immune system provided cortisol
elevated right times, right time cortisol elevated first
wake morning. increase cortisol also going increase metabolism.
also going increase ability focus mentally move body.
again, cortisol often demonized consider bad thing. indeed, don't
want cortisol chronically consistently elevated throughout day night.
want cortisol reach peak early day right time wake up.
One way can ensure cortisol peak occurs early day right
time wake view bright light, ideally sunlight, within first 30
60 minutes waking. right, view bright sunlight within first 30 60 minutes
waking. get caveats happens wake

simple. want trigger cortisol increase occur early day,
don't want cortisol peak happen later, will happen

set neurons reside roof mouth called suprachiasmatic
nucleus, cluster neurons sends huge number signals,
electrical chemical, entire body triggers cortisol increase,
provides wake-up signal brain body, sets motion timer

00:20:44 Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days

maybe 15 minutes, certainly within first hour waking. want share
three critical things tool morning sunlight viewing. First all,
not woo biology thing. grounded core physiology.
literally hundreds, not thousands, quality peer-reviewed papers showing light

really foundational power tool ensuring great night's sleep


feeling awake day. Second all, wake sun out,
can, probably should, flip artificial lights internal home environment
apartment wherever happen live goal awake, right? wake
four morning need awake, well, turn artificial lights.
sun out, however, sun risen, still want get outside
view sunlight. will wake sun comes out.
asking whether not turning artificial lights can replace sunlight hours,
unfortunately, answer no. Unless special light, talk
kind light, bright artificial lights home environment not, repeat,
not going sufficiently bright turn cortisol mechanism
wake-up mechanisms need early day. diabolical twist, however,

asymmetry retinal, eye biology, brain's biology, whereby
early day, right around waking, need lot light, lot photons, lot light
energy, artificial lights generally just won't accomplish need

called circadian, 24-hour clocks, mechanisms talking about.
wake sun still dark, please turn many bright
artificial lights possibly can need, get outside sun out.
cloudy days, especially need get outside. repeat, cloudy days, overcast days,
especially need get outside get sunlight. just need get it. Now,
much light much light viewing need? going vary

00:26:18 Evaluating Light Environment, Compensating Missed Morning Light

really nice get outside first thing morning get sunlight. fact,
start this, notice body will start feel energized will

that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy

throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit

say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early

strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food

funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period

might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall

sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want

00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research

people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.

supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict

put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat

00:15:10 Morning Tool: Morning Sunlight Viewing, Cortisol

can develop sleep toolkit ideal sleep needs. head
description tools optimizing sleep, consider perfect 24-hour
cycle look like. start 24-hour cycle wake
morning. you, will 5:00 a.m. others you, will 10:00
a.m. people, believe, wake sometime 6:30 a.m. 8:30 a.m.
regardless wake morning, one first things happens
body temperature increasing just going happen naturally.


going consequence moving around bit, really increase
body temperature one main triggers woke first place.
increase body temperature turn causes increase release
hormone called cortisol. Cortisol often discussed stress hormone, not just
associated stress. also enhances immune system provided cortisol
elevated right times, right time cortisol elevated first
wake morning. increase cortisol also going increase metabolism.
also going increase ability focus mentally move body.
again, cortisol often demonized consider bad thing. indeed, don't
want cortisol chronically consistently elevated throughout day night.
want cortisol reach peak early day right time wake up.
One way can ensure cortisol peak occurs early day right
time wake view bright light, ideally sunlight, within first 30
60 minutes waking. right, view bright sunlight within first 30 60 minutes
waking. get caveats happens wake
sun out, live UK no sun, people claim no
sun. Hate tell this, folks, sun UK. talk that.
everybody, whether not live cloudy place sunny place, whether not
cloud cover not day, really strive get bright light eyes,
ideally sunlight, within first 30 60 minutes waking. reason
simple. want trigger cortisol increase occur early day,
don't want cortisol peak happen later, will happen
wait get outside see sunlight. reason set

set neurons reside roof mouth called suprachiasmatic
nucleus, cluster neurons sends huge number signals,
electrical chemical, entire body triggers cortisol increase,
provides wake-up signal brain body, sets motion timer
fall asleep later night. again, not trying go much mechanism

00:20:44 Morning Sunlight: Circadian Rhythm, Artificial Lights, Cloudy Days

maybe 15 minutes, certainly within first hour waking. want share
three critical things tool morning sunlight viewing. First all,
not woo biology thing. grounded core physiology.
literally hundreds, not thousands, quality peer-reviewed papers showing light
viewing early day powerful stimulus wakefulness throughout
day powerful, positive impact ability fall stay asleep night.
really foundational power tool ensuring great night's sleep


feeling awake day. Second all, wake sun out,
can, probably should, flip artificial lights internal home environment
apartment wherever happen live goal awake, right? wake
four morning need awake, well, turn artificial lights.
sun out, however, sun risen, still want get outside
view sunlight. will wake sun comes out.
asking whether not turning artificial lights can replace sunlight hours,
unfortunately, answer no. Unless special light, talk
kind light, bright artificial lights home environment not, repeat,
not going sufficiently bright turn cortisol mechanism
wake-up mechanisms need early day. diabolical twist, however,
lights home apartment even phone bright enough
disrupt sleep look late night middle night.
asymmetry retinal, eye biology, brain's biology, whereby
early day, right around waking, need lot light, lot photons, lot light
energy, artificial lights generally just won't accomplish need
accomplish. night, even little bit artificial light can really mess so-
called circadian, 24-hour clocks, mechanisms talking about.
wake sun still dark, please turn many bright
artificial lights possibly can need, get outside sun out.
cloudy days, especially need get outside. repeat, cloudy days, overcast days,
especially need get outside get sunlight. just need get it. Now,
much light much light viewing need? going vary
depending person place, literally live earth, whether not

give general guidelines. general, clear day, meaning no cloud cover
minimal cloud cover, want get sunlight exposure eyes five
minutes so. three minutes one day, seven minutes next day,
five minutes. day cloud cover, sun just peeking
clouds dense cloud cover, want get 10 minutes
sunlight exposure eyes early day. days really densely
overcast maybe even rainy, going want get much 20 30
minutes sunlight exposure. Another key thing not, forget about, just don't try


get sunlight exposure windshield car window, whether not

00:26:18 Evaluating Light Environment, Compensating Missed Morning Light

really nice get outside first thing morning get sunlight. fact,
start this, notice body will start feel energized will

getting outside. Yes, can take morning beverage outside. Yes, can take


dog you. fact, animals intuitively know get morning sunlight.
actually seek right times days. human beings need told
podcasters people science supports kinds practices.
pets apparently not. get outside alone somebody, kids,

shuffle around outside, get sunlight, maybe read little bit, et cetera,
two main ways can that. first way get cold water sort.
cold shower anywhere one three minutes. ice

body brain interact bit thermostat system put something
cold surface body, brain, little cluster neurons so-called

just get one three minutes, cold shower one three
minutes, core body temperature will increase. get cold
water, body temperature increasing rate, slope, steeper
otherwise going feel alert. also advantage
increasing not just adrenaline, dopamine, molecule involved motivation,
focus, et cetera. great waking up. got sunlight, got
temperature triggered cold water, exercise. One best ways
increase core body temperature early day exercise. Now,
might choose full-blown workout day first thing wake
morning, say best time exercise, least research points
to, immediately wake morning three hours waking 11
hours waking. really getting optimization sake muscular

skipping rope. days, skip rope 10 minutes 20 minutes
looking sun. trying layer different things waking up.
take cold shower afterwards. lately, don't
year long necessarily. going working mid-morning.
sometimes that. try get core body temperature increased first thing

again, doesn't full-blown workout day workouts

use early day caffeine. Caffeine important compound think about.
realize people prone anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety

love caffeine. like form coffee espresso yerba mate tea, particular
non-smoked varieties yerba mate tea. Non-smoked smoked varieties
seem carry carcinogenics, cancer causing risk. increasing data
that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy
afternoon, not going massive crash. talked reasons
crash previous episodes. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking, great service towards wakefulness avoid

emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological

Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch

exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top

interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether

neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period

sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap

say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not

here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,

called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body

said brain body organs locked inside skin

sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly

day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

going consequence moving around bit, really increase
body temperature one main triggers woke first place.
increase body temperature turn causes increase release
hormone called cortisol. Cortisol often discussed stress hormone, not just
associated stress. also enhances immune system provided cortisol
elevated right times, right time cortisol elevated first
wake morning. increase cortisol also going increase metabolism.
also going increase ability focus mentally move body.
again, cortisol often demonized consider bad thing. indeed, don't
want cortisol chronically consistently elevated throughout day night.
want cortisol reach peak early day right time wake up.
One way can ensure cortisol peak occurs early day right
time wake view bright light, ideally sunlight, within first 30
60 minutes waking. right, view bright sunlight within first 30 60 minutes
waking. get caveats happens wake

everybody, whether not live cloudy place sunny place, whether not

neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body

Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake

number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort

Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask

dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,

supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken

something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't

temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will

wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier

00:29:26 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

will greatly assist ability fall stay asleep later night.
continue today's discussion, going take brief pause acknowledge
sponsor, Athletic Greens, also called AG1. started taking Athletic Greens way back
2012. delighted sponsor podcast. Athletic Greens
contains vitamins, minerals, probiotics, digestive enzymes, adaptogens. got
lot things there. actually reason started taking reason still
take twice day. essentially covers nutritional bases.
probiotics particular important critical importance
called gut-brain axis, neurons cell types gut, digestive

00:30:46 Morning Tools: Temperature & Deliberate Cold Exposure, Exercise

impact immediate long-term health. Again,
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Okay, now still
focusing early part day woken up, first hour
waking. can go list levers tools, right? light
dark. already talked light sunlight particular. got temperature,
food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, digital tools. Now, woken
want awake, okay? likely early day following
standard schedule. will also want leverage not just light, temperature


tool. inclined, wise try increase core body
temperature bit quickly otherwise just, know,
shuffle around outside, get sunlight, maybe read little bit, et cetera,
two main ways can that. first way get cold water sort.
cold shower anywhere one three minutes. ice
bath thing. cold tub, cold tub specifically
designed deliberate cold exposure. Get cold water. will certainly
wake up. ever jumped cold water cold shower, know
really wakes release adrenaline, epinephrine,
brain body, body adrenals brain little cluster
neurons called locus coeruleus. Again, names don't matter. One three minutes
cold water exposure will wake adrenaline release and, want
highlight and, will serve increase core body temperature. right,
body brain interact bit thermostat system put something
cold surface body, brain, little cluster neurons so-called
medial preoptic area, act thermostat say, "Ah, external body cold
therefore going heat core body temperature." little bit
paradoxical. People think, oh, get cold water ice bath, body
temperature going drop. indeed, true stay while,
just get one three minutes, cold shower one three
minutes, core body temperature will increase. get cold
water, body temperature increasing rate, slope, steeper
otherwise going feel alert. also advantage
increasing not just adrenaline, dopamine, molecule involved motivation,
focus, et cetera. great waking up. got sunlight, got
temperature triggered cold water, exercise. One best ways
increase core body temperature early day exercise. Now,
might choose full-blown workout day first thing wake
morning, say best time exercise, least research points
to, immediately wake morning three hours waking 11
hours waking. really getting optimization sake muscular
strength grip strength hard give strict prescriptive.
suggest. want alert early day want sleep great night, get
bright sunlight, get cold water, don't want get cold


water, try get movement. walk. can get sunlight
exposure taking walk first thing morning. light jog.
skipping rope. days, skip rope 10 minutes 20 minutes
looking sun. trying layer different things waking up.
take cold shower afterwards. lately, don't
year long necessarily. going working mid-morning.
sometimes that. try get core body temperature increased first thing
morning, great way cold water and/or exercise.
again, doesn't full-blown workout day workouts
consistently, hope everybody everybody really exercise
least, believe, five six, maybe even seven days week. me, six days
week, sometimes five, rarely seven. get exercise even just modest
amount movement, walking, jogging, skipping rope,

00:34:58 Timing Caffeine, “Afternoon Crash,” Exercise

light calisthenics. will increase core body temperature help
feel awake. category caffeine. again, just
talking early part day, might saying, "Wait second,
thought episode tools sleep." Well, everything talking
first 60 90 minutes day really set motion wave
biological cascades carry entire day evening
night really serve optimize sleep. just hang me.
interested focus attention, ability learn, tools
practices going greatly enhance well. next category tool
use early day caffeine. Caffeine important compound think about.
realize people prone anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety
attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. absolutely fine. not drink
caffeine. describe ways leverage caffeine use optimize
sleep wakefulness comfortable caffeine, like caffeine, happen
love caffeine. like form coffee espresso yerba mate tea, particular
non-smoked varieties yerba mate tea. Non-smoked smoked varieties
seem carry carcinogenics, cancer causing risk. increasing data
that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy
afternoon, not going massive crash. talked reasons
crash previous episodes. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking, great service towards wakefulness avoid
crash. afternoon crash another liability it, typically people will
emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,
going related elimination adenosine blockade caffeine.
getting kind one-two punch energy levels taking lot caffeine
exercising early day. can sort expect going get drop
energy early afternoon. okay works you, just know
delaying caffeine 90 120 minutes waking ideal scenario
days scenarios. said, absolutely respect fact people
different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. want none
tools, really you.

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability


autonomic timing. can start things really make naturally
wake six morning five morning. right, somebody
naturally night owl, likes stay two morning sleep 10:00
a.m., now job go school partner
likes get early go sleep early, well, can make happen can
make happen pretty painlessly take week go sleep 30 minutes
hour earlier night, set alarm wake 30 minutes hour earlier
morning until, course, waking time want wake up,
even groggy state, get exercise, get sunlight viewing. sun's
not out, turn bright artificial lights. breakfast, even not
hungry. fact, engage shift work to, travel
jet lagged, one quickest ways shift circadian clock

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period



00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body
Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap
late day staying late night hard time


waking next morning. will say lot people not like naps
find wake really grumpy naps groggy naps, encourage try
Reveri app, try NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something sort
anywhere 10 20 30 minutes. tend every day now. just lie down,
love yoga nidra, love NSDR scripts, love using Reveri app. particular,
portion Reveri app gets better sleeping. really beneficial
serves replenishing hypnosis, also gotten
much better falling staying asleep falling back asleep middle
night. critical period throughout day one people
lot stuff. emailing picking kids exercising
commuting sorts things, taking phone calls Zooms, et cetera.
can get period deep relaxation nap NSDR, going serve
well. Try not drink much caffeine, certainly no hundred milligrams
caffeine, 4:00 p.m goal fall asleep reasonably normal time.
exercise afternoon, understand exercise
intensely, might weight training running intense
exercise, typically going increase body temperature. Makes sense,
right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.
going so-called delay circadian clock. going make want
fall asleep little bit later, maybe even lot later. exercising afternoon
evening time can exercise time prefer
exercise, great, careful ingesting much caffeine order get
energy exercise 'cause caffeine will disrupt sleep just know
delaying circadian clock. making will naturally want
go sleep later wake later. Contrast exercise early day,
say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later
episode. critical period, too, middle day going want
leverage specific tools, talked those: limiting caffeine intake;
mindful clock-delaying effects exercise; fact that, also, going nap,


don't want nap long late day otherwise disrupt
nighttime sleep. critical period two, second critical period, say,
middle day

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort

Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed

tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,

within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking

wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule

jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body

that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get

delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy

throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit

much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning

strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period



00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body
Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake

sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap

waking next morning. will say lot people not like naps
find wake really grumpy naps groggy naps, encourage try
Reveri app, try NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something sort
anywhere 10 20 30 minutes. tend every day now. just lie down,
love yoga nidra, love NSDR scripts, love using Reveri app. particular,
portion Reveri app gets better sleeping. really beneficial

exercise afternoon, understand exercise
intensely, might weight training running intense
exercise, typically going increase body temperature. Makes sense,
right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.
going so-called delay circadian clock. going make want
fall asleep little bit later, maybe even lot later. exercising afternoon
evening time can exercise time prefer
exercise, great, careful ingesting much caffeine order get
energy exercise 'cause caffeine will disrupt sleep just know
delaying circadian clock. making will naturally want
go sleep later wake later. Contrast exercise early day,
say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later
episode. critical period, too, middle day going want
leverage specific tools, talked those: limiting caffeine intake;
mindful clock-delaying effects exercise; fact that, also, going nap,


don't want nap long late day otherwise disrupt
nighttime sleep. critical period two, second critical period, say,
middle day

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag

want awake, okay? likely early day following
standard schedule. will also want leverage not just light, temperature


tool. inclined, wise try increase core body
temperature bit quickly otherwise just, know,
shuffle around outside, get sunlight, maybe read little bit, et cetera,
two main ways can that. first way get cold water sort.
cold shower anywhere one three minutes. ice
bath thing. cold tub, cold tub specifically
designed deliberate cold exposure. Get cold water. will certainly
wake up. ever jumped cold water cold shower, know
really wakes release adrenaline, epinephrine,
brain body, body adrenals brain little cluster
neurons called locus coeruleus. Again, names don't matter. One three minutes
cold water exposure will wake adrenaline release and, want
highlight and, will serve increase core body temperature. right,
body brain interact bit thermostat system put something
cold surface body, brain, little cluster neurons so-called
medial preoptic area, act thermostat say, "Ah, external body cold
therefore going heat core body temperature." little bit
paradoxical. People think, oh, get cold water ice bath, body
temperature going drop. indeed, true stay while,
just get one three minutes, cold shower one three
minutes, core body temperature will increase. get cold
water, body temperature increasing rate, slope, steeper
otherwise going feel alert. also advantage
increasing not just adrenaline, dopamine, molecule involved motivation,
focus, et cetera. great waking up. got sunlight, got
temperature triggered cold water, exercise. One best ways
increase core body temperature early day exercise. Now,
might choose full-blown workout day first thing wake
morning, say best time exercise, least research points
to, immediately wake morning three hours waking 11
hours waking. really getting optimization sake muscular
strength grip strength hard give strict prescriptive.
suggest. want alert early day want sleep great night, get
bright sunlight, get cold water, don't want get cold


water, try get movement. walk. can get sunlight
exposure taking walk first thing morning. light jog.
skipping rope. days, skip rope 10 minutes 20 minutes
looking sun. trying layer different things waking up.
take cold shower afterwards. lately, don't
year long necessarily. going working mid-morning.
sometimes that. try get core body temperature increased first thing
morning, great way cold water and/or exercise.
again, doesn't full-blown workout day workouts
consistently, hope everybody everybody really exercise
least, believe, five six, maybe even seven days week. me, six days
week, sometimes five, rarely seven. get exercise even just modest
amount movement, walking, jogging, skipping rope,

00:34:58 Timing Caffeine, “Afternoon Crash,” Exercise

light calisthenics. will increase core body temperature help
feel awake. category caffeine. again, just
talking early part day, might saying, "Wait second,
thought episode tools sleep." Well, everything talking
first 60 90 minutes day really set motion wave
biological cascades carry entire day evening
night really serve optimize sleep. just hang me.
interested focus attention, ability learn, tools
practices going greatly enhance well. next category tool
use early day caffeine. Caffeine important compound think about.
realize people prone anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety
attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. absolutely fine. not drink
caffeine. describe ways leverage caffeine use optimize
sleep wakefulness comfortable caffeine, like caffeine, happen
love caffeine. like form coffee espresso yerba mate tea, particular
non-smoked varieties yerba mate tea. Non-smoked smoked varieties
seem carry carcinogenics, cancer causing risk. increasing data
that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy
afternoon, not going massive crash. talked reasons
crash previous episodes. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking, great service towards wakefulness avoid
crash. afternoon crash another liability it, typically people will
emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,
going related elimination adenosine blockade caffeine.
getting kind one-two punch energy levels taking lot caffeine
exercising early day. can sort expect going get drop
energy early afternoon. okay works you, just know
delaying caffeine 90 120 minutes waking ideal scenario
days scenarios. said, absolutely respect fact people
different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. want none
tools, really you.

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability


autonomic timing. can start things really make naturally
wake six morning five morning. right, somebody
naturally night owl, likes stay two morning sleep 10:00
a.m., now job go school partner
likes get early go sleep early, well, can make happen can
make happen pretty painlessly take week go sleep 30 minutes
hour earlier night, set alarm wake 30 minutes hour earlier
morning until, course, waking time want wake up,
even groggy state, get exercise, get sunlight viewing. sun's
not out, turn bright artificial lights. breakfast, even not
hungry. fact, engage shift work to, travel
jet lagged, one quickest ways shift circadian clock

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period



00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body
Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap
late day staying late night hard time


waking next morning. will say lot people not like naps
find wake really grumpy naps groggy naps, encourage try
Reveri app, try NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something sort
anywhere 10 20 30 minutes. tend every day now. just lie down,
love yoga nidra, love NSDR scripts, love using Reveri app. particular,
portion Reveri app gets better sleeping. really beneficial
serves replenishing hypnosis, also gotten
much better falling staying asleep falling back asleep middle
night. critical period throughout day one people
lot stuff. emailing picking kids exercising
commuting sorts things, taking phone calls Zooms, et cetera.
can get period deep relaxation nap NSDR, going serve
well. Try not drink much caffeine, certainly no hundred milligrams
caffeine, 4:00 p.m goal fall asleep reasonably normal time.
exercise afternoon, understand exercise
intensely, might weight training running intense
exercise, typically going increase body temperature. Makes sense,
right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.
going so-called delay circadian clock. going make want
fall asleep little bit later, maybe even lot later. exercising afternoon
evening time can exercise time prefer
exercise, great, careful ingesting much caffeine order get
energy exercise 'cause caffeine will disrupt sleep just know
delaying circadian clock. making will naturally want
go sleep later wake later. Contrast exercise early day,
say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later
episode. critical period, too, middle day going want
leverage specific tools, talked those: limiting caffeine intake;
mindful clock-delaying effects exercise; fact that, also, going nap,


don't want nap long late day otherwise disrupt
nighttime sleep. critical period two, second critical period, say,
middle day

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals

depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit
buffered resilient stress events. look literature

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side
bed

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

00:29:26 AG1 (Athletic Greens)

will greatly assist ability fall stay asleep later night.
continue today's discussion, going take brief pause acknowledge
sponsor, Athletic Greens, also called AG1. started taking Athletic Greens way back
2012. delighted sponsor podcast. Athletic Greens

00:30:46 Morning Tools: Temperature & Deliberate Cold Exposure, Exercise

impact immediate long-term health. Again,
athleticgreens.com/huberman claim special offer. Okay, now still
focusing early part day woken up, first hour
waking. can go list levers tools, right? light
dark. already talked light sunlight particular. got temperature,
food, exercise, caffeine, supplements, digital tools. Now, woken
want awake, okay? likely early day following
standard schedule. will also want leverage not just light, temperature


tool. inclined, wise try increase core body
temperature bit quickly otherwise just, know,
shuffle around outside, get sunlight, maybe read little bit, et cetera,
two main ways can that. first way get cold water sort.
cold shower anywhere one three minutes. ice
bath thing. cold tub, cold tub specifically
designed deliberate cold exposure. Get cold water. will certainly
wake up. ever jumped cold water cold shower, know
really wakes release adrenaline, epinephrine,
brain body, body adrenals brain little cluster
neurons called locus coeruleus. Again, names don't matter. One three minutes
cold water exposure will wake adrenaline release and, want
highlight and, will serve increase core body temperature. right,
body brain interact bit thermostat system put something
cold surface body, brain, little cluster neurons so-called
medial preoptic area, act thermostat say, "Ah, external body cold
therefore going heat core body temperature." little bit
paradoxical. People think, oh, get cold water ice bath, body
temperature going drop. indeed, true stay while,
just get one three minutes, cold shower one three
minutes, core body temperature will increase. get cold
water, body temperature increasing rate, slope, steeper
otherwise going feel alert. also advantage
increasing not just adrenaline, dopamine, molecule involved motivation,
focus, et cetera. great waking up. got sunlight, got
temperature triggered cold water, exercise. One best ways
increase core body temperature early day exercise. Now,
might choose full-blown workout day first thing wake
morning, say best time exercise, least research points
to, immediately wake morning three hours waking 11
hours waking. really getting optimization sake muscular
strength grip strength hard give strict prescriptive.
suggest. want alert early day want sleep great night, get
bright sunlight, get cold water, don't want get cold


water, try get movement. walk. can get sunlight
exposure taking walk first thing morning. light jog.
skipping rope. days, skip rope 10 minutes 20 minutes
looking sun. trying layer different things waking up.
take cold shower afterwards. lately, don't
year long necessarily. going working mid-morning.
sometimes that. try get core body temperature increased first thing
morning, great way cold water and/or exercise.
again, doesn't full-blown workout day workouts
consistently, hope everybody everybody really exercise
least, believe, five six, maybe even seven days week. me, six days
week, sometimes five, rarely seven. get exercise even just modest
amount movement, walking, jogging, skipping rope,

00:34:58 Timing Caffeine, “Afternoon Crash,” Exercise

light calisthenics. will increase core body temperature help
feel awake. category caffeine. again, just
talking early part day, might saying, "Wait second,
thought episode tools sleep." Well, everything talking
first 60 90 minutes day really set motion wave
biological cascades carry entire day evening
night really serve optimize sleep. just hang me.
interested focus attention, ability learn, tools
practices going greatly enhance well. next category tool
use early day caffeine. Caffeine important compound think about.
realize people prone anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety
attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. absolutely fine. not drink
caffeine. describe ways leverage caffeine use optimize
sleep wakefulness comfortable caffeine, like caffeine, happen
love caffeine. like form coffee espresso yerba mate tea, particular
non-smoked varieties yerba mate tea. Non-smoked smoked varieties
seem carry carcinogenics, cancer causing risk. increasing data
that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy
afternoon, not going massive crash. talked reasons
crash previous episodes. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking, great service towards wakefulness avoid
crash. afternoon crash another liability it, typically people will
emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,
going related elimination adenosine blockade caffeine.
getting kind one-two punch energy levels taking lot caffeine
exercising early day. can sort expect going get drop
energy early afternoon. okay works you, just know
delaying caffeine 90 120 minutes waking ideal scenario
days scenarios. said, absolutely respect fact people
different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. want none
tools, really you.

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability


autonomic timing. can start things really make naturally
wake six morning five morning. right, somebody
naturally night owl, likes stay two morning sleep 10:00
a.m., now job go school partner
likes get early go sleep early, well, can make happen can
make happen pretty painlessly take week go sleep 30 minutes
hour earlier night, set alarm wake 30 minutes hour earlier
morning until, course, waking time want wake up,
even groggy state, get exercise, get sunlight viewing. sun's
not out, turn bright artificial lights. breakfast, even not
hungry. fact, engage shift work to, travel
jet lagged, one quickest ways shift circadian clock

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period



00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body
Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap
late day staying late night hard time


waking next morning. will say lot people not like naps
find wake really grumpy naps groggy naps, encourage try
Reveri app, try NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something sort
anywhere 10 20 30 minutes. tend every day now. just lie down,
love yoga nidra, love NSDR scripts, love using Reveri app. particular,
portion Reveri app gets better sleeping. really beneficial
serves replenishing hypnosis, also gotten
much better falling staying asleep falling back asleep middle
night. critical period throughout day one people
lot stuff. emailing picking kids exercising
commuting sorts things, taking phone calls Zooms, et cetera.
can get period deep relaxation nap NSDR, going serve
well. Try not drink much caffeine, certainly no hundred milligrams
caffeine, 4:00 p.m goal fall asleep reasonably normal time.
exercise afternoon, understand exercise
intensely, might weight training running intense
exercise, typically going increase body temperature. Makes sense,
right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.
going so-called delay circadian clock. going make want
fall asleep little bit later, maybe even lot later. exercising afternoon
evening time can exercise time prefer
exercise, great, careful ingesting much caffeine order get
energy exercise 'cause caffeine will disrupt sleep just know
delaying circadian clock. making will naturally want
go sleep later wake later. Contrast exercise early day,
say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later
episode. critical period, too, middle day going want
leverage specific tools, talked those: limiting caffeine intake;
mindful clock-delaying effects exercise; fact that, also, going nap,


don't want nap long late day otherwise disrupt
nighttime sleep. critical period two, second critical period, say,
middle day

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.

First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict

put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance

body brain interact bit thermostat system put something
cold surface body, brain, little cluster neurons so-called

just get one three minutes, cold shower one three
minutes, core body temperature will increase. get cold
water, body temperature increasing rate, slope, steeper
otherwise going feel alert. also advantage
increasing not just adrenaline, dopamine, molecule involved motivation,
focus, et cetera. great waking up. got sunlight, got
temperature triggered cold water, exercise. One best ways
increase core body temperature early day exercise. Now,
might choose full-blown workout day first thing wake
morning, say best time exercise, least research points
to, immediately wake morning three hours waking 11
hours waking. really getting optimization sake muscular

looking sun. trying layer different things waking up.
take cold shower afterwards. lately, don't
year long necessarily. going working mid-morning.
sometimes that. try get core body temperature increased first thing

talking early part day, might saying, "Wait second,
thought episode tools sleep." Well, everything talking
first 60 90 minutes day really set motion wave

night really serve optimize sleep. just hang me.
interested focus attention, ability learn, tools
practices going greatly enhance well. next category tool
use early day caffeine. Caffeine important compound think about.
realize people prone anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety
attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. absolutely fine. not drink
caffeine. describe ways leverage caffeine use optimize
sleep wakefulness comfortable caffeine, like caffeine, happen
love caffeine. like form coffee espresso yerba mate tea, particular
non-smoked varieties yerba mate tea. Non-smoked smoked varieties
seem carry carcinogenics, cancer causing risk. increasing data
that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy
afternoon, not going massive crash. talked reasons
crash previous episodes. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking, great service towards wakefulness avoid
crash. afternoon crash another liability it, typically people will
emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,
going related elimination adenosine blockade caffeine.
getting kind one-two punch energy levels taking lot caffeine
exercising early day. can sort expect going get drop
energy early afternoon. okay works you, just know
delaying caffeine 90 120 minutes waking ideal scenario
days scenarios. said, absolutely respect fact people
different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. want none
tools, really you.

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability


autonomic timing. can start things really make naturally
wake six morning five morning. right, somebody
naturally night owl, likes stay two morning sleep 10:00
a.m., now job go school partner
likes get early go sleep early, well, can make happen can
make happen pretty painlessly take week go sleep 30 minutes
hour earlier night, set alarm wake 30 minutes hour earlier
morning until, course, waking time want wake up,
even groggy state, get exercise, get sunlight viewing. sun's
not out, turn bright artificial lights. breakfast, even not
hungry. fact, engage shift work to, travel
jet lagged, one quickest ways shift circadian clock

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period

Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature

tool. inclined, wise try increase core body
temperature bit quickly otherwise just, know,
shuffle around outside, get sunlight, maybe read little bit, et cetera,
two main ways can that. first way get cold water sort.
cold shower anywhere one three minutes. ice
bath thing. cold tub, cold tub specifically
designed deliberate cold exposure. Get cold water. will certainly
wake up. ever jumped cold water cold shower, know
really wakes release adrenaline, epinephrine,
brain body, body adrenals brain little cluster
neurons called locus coeruleus. Again, names don't matter. One three minutes
cold water exposure will wake adrenaline release and, want
highlight and, will serve increase core body temperature. right,
body brain interact bit thermostat system put something
cold surface body, brain, little cluster neurons so-called
medial preoptic area, act thermostat say, "Ah, external body cold
therefore going heat core body temperature." little bit
paradoxical. People think, oh, get cold water ice bath, body
temperature going drop. indeed, true stay while,
just get one three minutes, cold shower one three
minutes, core body temperature will increase. get cold
water, body temperature increasing rate, slope, steeper
otherwise going feel alert. also advantage
increasing not just adrenaline, dopamine, molecule involved motivation,
focus, et cetera. great waking up. got sunlight, got
temperature triggered cold water, exercise. One best ways
increase core body temperature early day exercise. Now,
might choose full-blown workout day first thing wake
morning, say best time exercise, least research points
to, immediately wake morning three hours waking 11
hours waking. really getting optimization sake muscular
strength grip strength hard give strict prescriptive.
suggest. want alert early day want sleep great night, get
bright sunlight, get cold water, don't want get cold


water, try get movement. walk. can get sunlight

skipping rope. days, skip rope 10 minutes 20 minutes
looking sun. trying layer different things waking up.
take cold shower afterwards. lately, don't
year long necessarily. going working mid-morning.
sometimes that. try get core body temperature increased first thing
morning, great way cold water and/or exercise.
again, doesn't full-blown workout day workouts
consistently, hope everybody everybody really exercise

talking early part day, might saying, "Wait second,
thought episode tools sleep." Well, everything talking
first 60 90 minutes day really set motion wave
biological cascades carry entire day evening
night really serve optimize sleep. just hang me.
interested focus attention, ability learn, tools
practices going greatly enhance well. next category tool
use early day caffeine. Caffeine important compound think about.
realize people prone anxiety, especially panic attacks, anxiety
attacks, might avoid caffeine entirely. absolutely fine. not drink
caffeine. describe ways leverage caffeine use optimize
sleep wakefulness comfortable caffeine, like caffeine, happen
love caffeine. like form coffee espresso yerba mate tea, particular
non-smoked varieties yerba mate tea. Non-smoked smoked varieties
seem carry carcinogenics, cancer causing risk. increasing data
that. non-smoked varieties yerba mate. caffeine something lot


people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy
afternoon, not going massive crash. talked reasons
crash previous episodes. delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes
waking, great service towards wakefulness avoid
crash. afternoon crash another liability it, typically people will
emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,
going related elimination adenosine blockade caffeine.
getting kind one-two punch energy levels taking lot caffeine
exercising early day. can sort expect going get drop
energy early afternoon. okay works you, just know
delaying caffeine 90 120 minutes waking ideal scenario
days scenarios. said, absolutely respect fact people
different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. want none
tools, really you.

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability


autonomic timing. can start things really make naturally
wake six morning five morning. right, somebody
naturally night owl, likes stay two morning sleep 10:00
a.m., now job go school partner
likes get early go sleep early, well, can make happen can
make happen pretty painlessly take week go sleep 30 minutes
hour earlier night, set alarm wake 30 minutes hour earlier
morning until, course, waking time want wake up,
even groggy state, get exercise, get sunlight viewing. sun's
not out, turn bright artificial lights. breakfast, even not
hungry. fact, engage shift work to, travel
jet lagged, one quickest ways shift circadian clock

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period



00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body
Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap
late day staying late night hard time


waking next morning. will say lot people not like naps
find wake really grumpy naps groggy naps, encourage try
Reveri app, try NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something sort
anywhere 10 20 30 minutes. tend every day now. just lie down,
love yoga nidra, love NSDR scripts, love using Reveri app. particular,
portion Reveri app gets better sleeping. really beneficial
serves replenishing hypnosis, also gotten
much better falling staying asleep falling back asleep middle
night. critical period throughout day one people
lot stuff. emailing picking kids exercising
commuting sorts things, taking phone calls Zooms, et cetera.
can get period deep relaxation nap NSDR, going serve
well. Try not drink much caffeine, certainly no hundred milligrams
caffeine, 4:00 p.m goal fall asleep reasonably normal time.
exercise afternoon, understand exercise
intensely, might weight training running intense
exercise, typically going increase body temperature. Makes sense,
right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.
going so-called delay circadian clock. going make want
fall asleep little bit later, maybe even lot later. exercising afternoon
evening time can exercise time prefer
exercise, great, careful ingesting much caffeine order get
energy exercise 'cause caffeine will disrupt sleep just know
delaying circadian clock. making will naturally want
go sleep later wake later. Contrast exercise early day,
say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later
episode. critical period, too, middle day going want
leverage specific tools, talked those: limiting caffeine intake;
mindful clock-delaying effects exercise; fact that, also, going nap,


don't want nap long late day otherwise disrupt
nighttime sleep. critical period two, second critical period, say,
middle day

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright

exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit

say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,

people consume early day. much depends tolerance,
lot individual variability here. Again, caffeine adenosine antagonist, effectively
works adenosine antagonist limits sleepiness. highly recommend
everybody delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking. However
painful may eventually arrive 90 120 minutes waking, want,
encourage you, clear whatever residual adenosine circulating
system first 90 120 minutes day. Get sunlight exposure, get
movement wake up, then, then, start ingest caffeine
delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking will avoid
so-called afternoon crash. may still get little bit dip energy

emerge afternoon crash either grumpy groggy lean
drinking caffeine, can disrupt sleep. wait 90 120 minutes
waking morning drink caffeine. drink caffeine point
throughout day, really try avoid caffeine, certainly avoid drinking
hundred milligrams caffeine 4:00 p.m. probably even better limit
last caffeine intake 3:00 p.m. even 2:00 p.m. many people, shifting
caffeine intake immediately waking morning 90 120 minutes gives
much longer arc energy throughout day don't feel need
drink caffeine later afternoon. drink caffeine later afternoon,
really try limit total amount drink decaf. Certainly keep total amount less
hundred milligrams interested getting best possible sleep.
say knowing many people, including myself, can drink double espresso
200 milligrams caffeine 5:00 p.m. even 6:00 p.m. dinner
still, quote, unquote, fall asleep fine still sleep fine. However, terrific data,
Matt Walker talked this, papers time
point fact caffeine intake late day, 4:00 p.m. is, can really
disrupt architecture sleep. might think sleeping well,
not sleeping nearly well avoided caffeine afternoon hours.
Now, might main exercise first thing morning
want caffeine exercise. case, say, go it.


Drink caffeine, workout right waking up. don't problem
that. will find, however, going get early afternoon dip energy
dip energy going substantial going dip energy
naturally follows workout morning. dependent temperature,
going related elimination adenosine blockade caffeine.
getting kind one-two punch energy levels taking lot caffeine
exercising early day. can sort expect going get drop

delaying caffeine 90 120 minutes waking ideal scenario
days scenarios. said, absolutely respect fact people
different work schedules, kid schedules, et cetera. want none
tools, really you.

00:40:08 Timing Eating, Alertness & Circadian Rhythm

just providing simplest form can possibly provide them. Now,
lever tool available food. Not just eat,
eat. turns eat early day, support biological
clock mechanism will make alert early day. said, many people
choose fast early morning hours day first part day. one
person. generally don't ingest food 11:00 a.m. 12 noon.
Sometimes protein shake. Sometimes almonds. Sometimes
breakfast. people meeting brunch breakfast, will breakfast
social reasons every while. time don't eat lunch
time. However, people really hungry wake morning. Just
know eat early day, triggering increase metabolism
temperature will make alert. don't eat early
day, can start see different tools layer together. Sunlight viewing,
exercise, cold water, eating. Many converging mechanisms.
fact, drink caffeine, also small increase body temperature due
adrenaline increase stimulates. things can layered top
one another can use individually think individually. Now, food
interesting lever tool not just eat, also
eat. talked lot eating energy means terms


caloric energy versus neural energy, et cetera, previous podcast episodes.
not going focus now because, frankly, get description whether
not somebody eat fruits vegetables animal proteins dairy, et cetera, early
day, nuanced. eat breakfast, choose not
eat breakfast, really you. said, eat large meal, doesn't
matter slept terrifically well 10 hours night go
sleep middle afternoon, gut full food, just large
volume food gut, going divert lot blood critical resources
away organs body, particular, brain, going
sleepy eating big meal. sort duh, think oftentimes
discussions eat energy, people neglect consider food volume
strong parameter variable discussion. eat huge breakfast, likely
going tired immediately eating breakfast unless course
exercise hard prior metabolize food quickly.
whether not eat first thing morning not. eat
first hours morning, just understand setting helping
set food entrained, called, circadian clock. Light, temperature, timing food
intake, movement exercise, things literally funnel neural sense,
funnel thing call circadian clock let clock, set
neurons, predict likely eating active viewing sunlight
next day next day next day. say
beautiful studies, highlight one, again, show note captions, show
people hard time waking morning, one things can
maximize sunlight viewing, exercise morning, drink caffeine. Although, again,
support idea best done 90 120 minutes waking.
Eating food early morning hours, et cetera, et cetera. can layer
multiple levers tools order alert. levers tools
really sense talking today, optimizing
sleep. Yes, will make alert. Yes, will provide adrenaline
dopamine, instance, cold water, et cetera, et cetera. reason talking
things context sleep start give body
predictable autonomic timing. predictable autonomic timing? Well,
autonomic nervous system components brain body cause
wakefulness sleepiness can start create predictability


autonomic timing. can start things really make naturally
wake six morning five morning. right, somebody
naturally night owl, likes stay two morning sleep 10:00
a.m., now job go school partner
likes get early go sleep early, well, can make happen can
make happen pretty painlessly take week go sleep 30 minutes
hour earlier night, set alarm wake 30 minutes hour earlier
morning until, course, waking time want wake up,
even groggy state, get exercise, get sunlight viewing. sun's
not out, turn bright artificial lights. breakfast, even not
hungry. fact, engage shift work to, travel
jet lagged, one quickest ways shift circadian clock

00:45:20 3 Daily Critical Periods

get onto local schedule eat local schedule. tools
really set cascade. Think kind wavefront wakefulness
focus throughout day. It'll take middle day afternoon
stage talk minutes, really take period
5:00 p.m. bedtime. realize people going bed early,
like 8:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m., seems early, people go
sleep 5:00 p.m. right? Unless shift work reasons.
5:00 p.m. bedtime really critical period need leverage
particular tools order get stay asleep optimally able sleep
night. really three critical periods throughout 24-hour cycle.
critical periods, going want many specific things
can optimize wakefulness focus mood throughout day
sleep night. first critical period one talking
now. Things like morning sunlight viewing, caffeine 90 120 minutes waking,
exercise, on. can call critical period one really encompasses
time wake three hours waking. Although, just
mention 'cause always people say, "Wait, wake 4:00 a.m.
sun isn't 8:00 a.m.," okay, might four hours. really
early morning hours day awake. second critical period



00:46:49 Afternoons: Naps, Deep Relaxation (NSDR, Self-Hypnosis), Exercise & Body
Temperature, Caffeine

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon
hours feeling kind sleepy, even though optimize caffeine intake
timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question
get asked lot asked Dr. Matthew Walker guest
podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can
make whole day without napping, great, power you.
nap find naps serve well, keep naps shorter 90 minutes
reasons related ultradian cycles forth, make sure don't nap
late day staying late night hard time


waking next morning. will say lot people not like naps
find wake really grumpy naps groggy naps, encourage try
Reveri app, try NSDR script, try yoga nidra. Try something sort
anywhere 10 20 30 minutes. tend every day now. just lie down,
love yoga nidra, love NSDR scripts, love using Reveri app. particular,
portion Reveri app gets better sleeping. really beneficial
serves replenishing hypnosis, also gotten
much better falling staying asleep falling back asleep middle
night. critical period throughout day one people
lot stuff. emailing picking kids exercising
commuting sorts things, taking phone calls Zooms, et cetera.
can get period deep relaxation nap NSDR, going serve
well. Try not drink much caffeine, certainly no hundred milligrams
caffeine, 4:00 p.m goal fall asleep reasonably normal time.
exercise afternoon, understand exercise
intensely, might weight training running intense
exercise, typically going increase body temperature. Makes sense,
right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.
going so-called delay circadian clock. going make want
fall asleep little bit later, maybe even lot later. exercising afternoon
evening time can exercise time prefer
exercise, great, careful ingesting much caffeine order get
energy exercise 'cause caffeine will disrupt sleep just know
delaying circadian clock. making will naturally want
go sleep later wake later. Contrast exercise early day,
say, immediately waking first zero four hours waking,
cases, not going shift circadian clock much. toward end
episode, talk little bit forced exercise prior wake-up times. doesn't
mean exercise sleep. means deliberately setting alarm getting
bed much earlier naturally would. turns potent tool
so-called advance circadian clock. can talk little bit later
episode. critical period, too, middle day going want
leverage specific tools, talked those: limiting caffeine intake;
mindful clock-delaying effects exercise; fact that, also, going nap,


don't want nap long late day otherwise disrupt
nighttime sleep. critical period two, second critical period, say,
middle day

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake

First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical

temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed

wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific

period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side
bed

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright

exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing

00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing

00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit
buffered resilient stress events. look literature

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical

time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not

exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed

wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two

time throughout day afternoon leading evening. may ask
things can throughout day, middle day
afternoon evening hours, really going set best possible
sleep later night. Well, dos don'ts. First all,
careful ingesting much caffeine throughout middle day. kind
obvious one reasons talked earlier. Second all,
napper, raise hand now, listening, raising right hand
love naps. always loved naps. Nowadays NSDR Reveri sleep
hypnosis almost every day. tend that, mentioned, early afternoon

timing, et cetera, tend get little sleepy afternoon. people get little
sleepy afternoon. related hitting peak body temperature.
might think, wait, thought high body temperature associated alertness,
is, right crest high body temperature body temperature
starts drop, tendency little bit sleepy. might opt
take nap afternoon. nap, not nap? question

podcast. answer data support. fine nap
afternoon, don't nap late day long disrupts ability fall
stay asleep night major sleep about, okay? naps fine, don't
sleep long day late day disrupts ability fall
stay asleep. also say not nap. kind interesting
phenomenon happens podcasts social media talk
naps fact naps great, don't make longer 90
minutes, non-nappers get really worried. Like, wait, supposed
nap? don't like naps. wake groggy. not nap. fact, can

right? Based everything know metabolism body temperature.

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want
look this. really kind fun cool look at. Well, yellows blues
oranges see evening sunsets, signal brain body
evening nighttime coming really establishing
second reference point wavefront biological signals



00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not

night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict

put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate
nervous system negative effects bright artificial light even
dim artificial light nighttime hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.,
really critical period three. talk not
critical period three every 24-hour cycle. make clear saying
here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,
starts descend sky. Again, don't stare directly sun, although
can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud
cover, just comes bunch bright light, well, next time
morning, take look sunrise looks like. lot yellow-blue contrast,
yellow blues signal important specific sets cells eye brain
morning. evening, also going see yellow blue, ratio
yellows blues now changed also see oranges, really
brilliant sunset, see reds. haven't noticed already, really want

00:56:45 Evening/Night Tools: Overhead Artificial Lights, Light Sensitivity

going optimize nighttime hours transition really terrific
sleep. now talk calling critical period three 24-hour cycle.
period time late evening, might 6:00 p.m. some,
depending go sleep, 7:00 p.m. extending hours
decide get bed go sleep throughout night.
number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes
down, which, course, going happen different times year different places
earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going

hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall

exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation

cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..

put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance

00:51:59 Afternoon Tools: Viewing Sunlight Late Afternoon, Evening Light

time certain things avoiding certain things.
raises question whether not also getting lot light,
particular, sunlight, throughout day. Now, something hasn't explored
much literature recently Dr. Samer Hattar director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, decided number
experiments exploring effects light mood aspects brain function
body function light delivered not just morning, great
us, also throughout day. looking sunlight bright artificial
lights throughout day? Now, face it, might just think, yes, know,
sunlight's great. Provided not getting sunburn not staring sun
damaging eyes, get much sunlight possibly can. fact,
talked episode hormones getting light onto much
skin can throughout day can really help production testosterone
estrogen men women healthy ways improves mood libido
sorts things associated wellbeing. However, light
powerful stimulus controlling timing sleepfulness, sleepiness,
say, wakefulness, might want cautious much light
viewing afternoon, particular, early evening hours, right? Well, turns
not straightforward. Viewing, sunlight eyes, sunlight late afternoon
evening hours, again, depends time year, depends location
happen in, getting sunlight eyes for, again, maybe five 10,
maybe 30 minutes, depending much cloud cover is,
afternoon serves additional beneficial purpose, protect inoculate

here, get morning sunlight eyes, also get sunlight eyes


late afternoon evening hours sun so-called low solar angle,

can catch nice, beautiful sunset, go it. sun starts descend,
triggers neurons eye communicate circadian clock,
communicates different component different compartment within circadian
clock. circadian clock not just one thing. multiple things.
called morning oscillators evening oscillators. make long story short,
tool describing looking sun late afternoon evening, again,
blinking fine, don't stare sun, getting sunlight eyes late
afternoon evening signals clock evening time sleep
coming. also serves second anchor reference point body
brain know time. Remember back beginning episode
said brain body organs locked inside skin
skull don't know going outside world. Well, morning
sunlight viewing things critical period one, provide one
strong set signals wake-up time time alert time focused.
evening, getting sunlight eyes again, particular, sunlight
comes low solar angle sunlight, well, provides second stimulus second
reference point tells brain body, "Hey, evening. sun descending."
Now, might say, "Wait, brain neurons know difference
morning light evening light?" turns particular
wavelengths light present morning versus evening. incredible
mechanism. probably familiar fact sun directly
overhead, really bright white yellow sky's often blue, cloud

number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early
day sunlight. However, really diabolical twist, mentioned earlier,
diabolical twist way brain body respond light early
day, morning hours, need lot bright light, ideally sunlight,
alert wake up, evening hours nighttime hours, takes
little light, photons, order wake brain body disrupt
circadian clock disrupt sleep. means sun goes

earth, sun goes down, wise try dim lights
indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw

need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going

cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

indoor environment days, right? realize nights going throw
party people over. might not want dim lights. nights
going go out, might view lot bright lights. nights life,
going want dim lights internal environment. ideally, lights
use place low physical environment. try not
use overhead lights, rather rely desk lamps lights even placed low floor,
even floor. going use light night, people do,
encourage use little artificial light required carry activities


need require safely. studying, case might need little bit
light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind
sleep cycle, house dark lucky able find spoon
kitchen. fact, lucky find way hallway me.
case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side
bed

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag

instance, need stay really late one night wake especially early, like 3:00 a.m.,
prepare exam just not ready head airport, et cetera,
using red light shown allow people awake enough obviously see

number things going want number things
going want avoid order optimize sleep. First all,
going want avoid bright artificial lights color. Yes, color. haven't
talked lot blue blockers, know, lenses block blue wavelengths short
wavelengths light. don't anything blue blockers. fact, many people
find blue blockers provide relief headache eye strain
wear blue blockers throughout day certainly night. don't need
them, even wear them, will find lights bright, doesn't
matter blue light, yellow light, red light, bright lights will wake
brain body. will activate mechanisms activated early

light order read study. watching television show
watching something computer, dim screen way, way down, dim
possible still, course, able view need view. Even better,
say, ideally, use candlelight and/or moonlight. Now, nights
moon really bright actually can use moonlight go usual
activities. Moonlight might seem very, bright, but, actually, moonlight fairly low
light intensity, candlelight, can also seem bright, actually low light
intensity. sitting across table candlelight really bright
candle, chances three 10 lux, very, little light energy
compared to, say, artificial desk lamp overhead light, going
area anywhere hundred thousand lux. candlelight fine. course,
cautious open flame, candlelight fine. Moonlight fine. Dimming artificial
lights fine provided dimmed way, way down. again, try avoid using
overhead artificial lights. absolute worst lights going overhead fluorescent
lights sort supermarket see gas
station something sort. confess, times driving
home late night want able get sleep need stop
grocery store gas station something like that, actually put sunglasses
night order avoid getting bright light exposure night. Although little bit
extreme, done time time bright light exposure will
absolutely quash, will eliminate, melatonin happens circulating
brain body. Now, melatonin, lot people think supplement,
melatonin naturally released evening comes nighttime hours.
hormone makes feel sleepy allows fall asleep. viewing
bright light late evening hours nighttime hours really not good sleep
quality ability fall stay asleep. people, simple rule thumb
going avoid bright artificial lights colors, particular, overhead bright
artificial lights, hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. right,
10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m., avoid bright artificial lights much possible. Use
much light absolutely necessary order carry routines
activities need carry safely. mention reason overhead lights
problematic reason sunlight great early day,
cells, is, neurons, can wake brain body


activation circadian clock reside mainly bottom half 2/3 neural
retina way optics eyes work cells bottom half
eye view upper visual field. beautiful adaptive mechanism
allows cells respond overhead light sunlight early part day
throughout day. evening, bright artificial lights
bright artificial lights overhead lights, going closely mimic
sunlight evening time, turns bad thing goal
eventually go sleep. again, like Scandinavians do. Use lights set
low room night, really want optimize sleep-wake cycles,
suppose also opposite throughout day. really emphasize
use bright artificial lights sunlight comes above. course,
sunlight always comes above. working given office environment
and, know, 2:00 p.m. 3:00 p.m. want awake possible,
really crank overhead lights. evening, critical period
three referring to, really try dim lights off just rely
candlelight moonlight hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m. good
friend Samer Hattar, podcast before, Samer director
chronobiology unit National Institutes Mental Health, well, absolutely
obsessive light stuff avoiding light night. fact, lives sort
joke like cave night. 9:00 p.m. 5:00 a.m., really kind

case, dim lights. Turn way, way down. will serve well. will make
much easier get sleepy stay sleepy fall asleep stay asleep
throughout night. Now, not depart critical period three, recall,
viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed
people view evening sunset light evening sunsets sunlight right around time
sunset, really serves inoculate offset some, again, some, not all,


negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side
bed

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

viewing afternoon light, low solar angle light sun heading
sky, sunset call circa sunset, around sunset, well,
going slightly, not completely, offset negative effects viewing artificial
light night. don't want give people pass here, say know
going watch Netflix night going late studying yet
still want able fall stay asleep. Definitely make sure see
evening light. great study. provide link study, showed

negative effects artificial light hours 10:00 p.m. 4:00 a.m.

01:04:40 Evening Tools: Hot Bath/Sauna, Temperature & Sleeping Environment

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature
evening exact opposite way want leverage temperature early
day. Early day, temperature increases cold showers exercise, et
cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop
one three degrees will make much easier get sleep.
somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting
fan room opening window. Again, depends time year, depends
technology, depends budgets, et cetera. going want sleep
relatively cool cold sleeping environment layer blankets needed
stay asleep. say needed one things going
sleep, happen wake up, warm, going put foot
hand blankets. reason logical
understand mechanism. special portals, essentially
ways passing heat, excuse me, body primarily palms
hands, upper half face, bottoms feet so-called
glabrous skin. covered episode Dr. Craig Heller biology


department Stanford. lower temperature sleeping environment,
lower temperature room use controllable mattress cover can cool
like Eight Sleep something sort, naturally going make sleep
environment cooler, warm blankets,
extend hand foot blankets. Whereas sleeping
environment warm, little can cool off besides
push off blankets. instance, warm waking
middle night, happens get warm, push off
blankets. room warm, well, going do? probably
put hands cool water take coolish shower something
couple seconds. not practical. Better just keep sleeping environment
cool. not big fan people putting socks sleep, say,
not fan putting socks sleep, eliminates glabrous skin
portal bottoms one's feet. heard, know, wear
socks sleep, works great people tend run cold
sleep wake feet get cold, somebody wakes
middle night, chances waking getting warm
best thing cool lower temperature room
sleeping not wear socks, get many blankets need fall
asleep, across night, naturally just move hand foot hands
feet blankets cool off relationship
temperature sleep. is, dropping core body temperature one three
degrees gets sleep helps stay asleep. say exercise late
day finding alert evening need fall
asleep, say exercised needed four cups espresso order
exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine
system. again, can use mechanism temperature shifts wake
temperature shifts fall asleep ways really can help overcome
irregularities sleep-wake cycle exercise cycle, et cetera. Because, course,
nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss


workout entirely. days, end cup coffee afternoon
friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit
buffered resilient stress events. look literature

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag

instance, need stay really late one night wake especially early, like 3:00 a.m.,
prepare exam just not ready head airport, et cetera,
using red light shown allow people awake enough obviously see

Now, light. recall, also tool related temperature,
probably not going surprised way leverage temperature

cetera, wake up. means taking cold shower late night
probably bad idea. Rather, taking nice hot bath sauna, might think
heat body, indeed, happens stay long time,
hot tub hot bath sauna evening, don't stay
20 30 minutes get out, take maybe cool-ish shower warm
shower, happens compensatory cooling off core body
temperature reasons discussed earlier, body temperature will drop

somebody enjoys hot baths, hot showers, hot tubs, evening nighttime
going best time goal facilitate sleep. Similarly,
try make sleeping environment pretty cool, not cold. Now, doesn't mean
need cold asleep. can get many blankets
need, good idea make sleeping environment cool. fact, drop
temperature sleeping environment least three degrees happy
did. Now, people rely things like Eight Sleep. use that. One
controllable temperature mattress covers. people simply putting

exercise. Well, things can try bring
nervous system state calmness, can also lowering
core body temperature. One already talked before, taking nice
hot shower hot bath getting cooling off will decrease body
temperature. Maybe not enough get sleep ton caffeine

nobody's perfect. days end workout afternoon miss

friend hard time falling asleep. can use tools not
just optimized form, know, absolutely obsessive compulsive
exactly tools. wonderful, life happens
say days going feel alert night want fall
asleep, got get especially early next morning not
somebody normally goes bed 10:00 p.m. Well, something like
hot bath sauna

01:09:40 Alcohol, THC & Reduced Sleep Quality; CBD, Anxiety & Falling Asleep

can really benefit can adjust temperature rhythm accordingly.
remiss didn't touch alcohol CBD THC. always get questions
these. say, course, many places, not all, THC illegal.
Although, medical uses places, decriminalized, places
legal. Alcohol, course, consumed almost frequently caffeine consumed.
personally don't drink alcohol. don't anything per se. just don't tend
enjoy it. One reasons don't enjoy drink alcohol, simply fall asleep.
doesn't really accomplish things really want accomplish
sleep one gets drinking alcohol greatly disrupted sleep. Hate break
you, truth. Dr. Matt Walker came podcast, said
exactly thing. THC alcohol help people fall asleep
maybe even stay asleep, architecture sleep suboptimal compared
sleep get without alcohol THC system. not tell
not do. certainly not substance police. not role. just
reporting biology. sleep not restoring extent feel
should, regularly relying drink two order fall asleep, THC
order fall asleep, disrupting total pattern sleep. However, realize
nowadays lot people relying THC and/or CBD, especially edible forms,
order fall stay asleep. And, know, can just acknowledge data.
seem anxiety lowering effect compounds help
people hard time falling staying asleep reasons related
anxiety. Although, moment, talk supplements supplement
protocols can also assist ability fall stay asleep can adjust


anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,
don't really know say except subjective terms, feel bit

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent

Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask

dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated

people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag

instance, need stay really late one night wake especially early, like 3:00 a.m.,
prepare exam just not ready head airport, et cetera,
using red light shown allow people awake enough obviously see

look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess

Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep

obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just

done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking

sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-

Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake

anxiety not seem disrupt sleep architecture negative ways

01:11:45 Sleep Supplements: Magnesium Threonate, Apigenin & Theanine

and, fact, can enhance depth quality sleep architecture. Okay,
done everything correctly now. got morning routine critical period
one. got afternoon routine. saw sunlight afternoon.
avoided caffeine eight hours 10 hours bedtime. not drinking
alcohol. cooled room. things right.
dimmed lights, et cetera, et cetera. else can order optimize
sleep? Well, always say behavioral tools first, look nutrition, then, necessary,
look supplementation, then, still necessary, look prescription drugs obviously
prescribed board certified physician. Well, talked lot behavioral
tools critical period three. not talked lot supplementation-based
tools. supplements people will greatly improve ability fall
stay asleep three main supplements category kit sleep
supplements, talked before, magnesium threonate, T-H-R-E-
O-N-A-T-E, apigenin, A-P-I-G-E-N-I-N, apigenin, theanine, T-H-E-A-N-I-N-E,
theanine. Now, important things point mag threonate, called,
apigenin, theanine. First all, don't necessarily need take three, although,
many people get synergistic effect taking three. fact, may not even need
take even one. recommend already behavioral
tools regularly still trouble falling asleep staying asleep, well,
might try one supplements within sleep stack. fairly wide
margins safety. Although, also say, anytime going add remove
something supplement protocol nutritional program, definitely want
talk physician. don't just say protect us. say protect you.
people, margins safety things going pretty broad.
couple notes dosages. people, dosages one several
supplements mentioned will zero. is, won't need order get
stay asleep nights life. terrific don't need them. many
people, however, taking 145 milligrams magnesium threonate can beneficial.
dosage people will benefit from. people need go little
higher. people need go little bit lower. One reasons


pointing people towards single-ingredient formulations days allows
people adjust dosage one component so-called sleep stack without
disrupt dosage another component, on. also allows people try just
one element within sleep stack without purchase try others,
problem buying blend lot different ingredients. 145 milligrams
magnesium threonate. 50, 5-0, milligrams apigenin. again, just take
apigenin own. 100 400 milligrams theanine taken, again, alone
combination supplements mentioned stack many people find allows
get really drowsy fall asleep, sleep really deeply, feel much
refreshed next day don't grogginess them. Now, couple notes
different supplements. 5% people report magnesium threonate
really disrupts gut. gives diarrhea gastric distress. case, don't
take it. magnesium threonate disrupts gut digestion point
uncomfortable don't like it, don't take it. proper dosage
you, words, zero milligrams. Now, slightly different way, many
people can tolerate magnesium threonate really thrive magnesium threonate
like apigenin might find theanine, even lowest dose hundred
milligrams, 'cause, again, range hundred 400 milligrams, theanine gives
vivid dreams actually find disruptive wake
middle night find sleep getting kind anxiety ridden
intensity dreams. people might choose leave
theanine sleep stack just take magnesium threonate apigenin
again, people might leave magnesium threonate sleep stack. Again,
really finding supplementation protocol ideal you.
mention whether not taking one two three components
sleep stack, ideal time take 30 60 minutes bedtime, especially
haven't anything eat three hours bedtime. confess
oftentimes little bit snack late evening, berries something.
try not eat close bedtime, evenings just work schedule,
get home late, 9:00 p.m.,

01:16:34 Melatonin Supplementation (Caution)

eat big meal take sleep stack fall asleep. Every


while, just happens. Nobody's perfect. Certainly not. sleep stack can
beneficial. think preferable melatonin. reason.
First all, melatonin hormone endogenously make. now know lot
melatonin controlled light, meaning light inhibits eliminates it,
darkness promotes it. melatonin indeed can help us fall asleep, dosages
melatonin contained commercial products far, far, far greater
make endogenously. really supraphysiological.
concern melatonin not just responsible making us sleepy fall asleep.
also things like interacts hormone systems, testosterone estrogen,
even puberty system, kids. taking melatonin every problem
adjusting jet lag, et cetera? Probably not. even say no. taking
chronically time, especially kids taking chronically time, can potentially
problematic. least opinion, supplements

01:17:44 Additional Sleep Supplements: GABA, Glycine, Myo-Inositol & Anxiety

going preferable melatonin. Now, mentioned beginning today's
episode, things certainly take every
people might consider taking addition sleep stack talked
place sleep stack sleep stack doesn't work well them. every third
fourth night, will take two grams glycine hundred milligrams GABA
addition standard sleep stack talked before. taking mag
threonate, apigenin, theanine, will also take two grams glycine
GABA, find greatly enhances ability get sleep. reason
add glycine GABA every third fourth night take often, find
entire sleep stack doesn't work quite effectively. don't know exactly
case, event, do. recently, also started using
inositol, particular myo-inositol. Every night, take 900 milligrams myo-
inositol addition mag threonate, apigenin, theanine, not nights
take glycine GABA. adding 900 milligrams inositol standard sleep
stack mag threonate, theanine, apigenin. find not
greatly enhance ability fall asleep quickly, wake middle
night, often use bathroom, find very, easy fall back asleep.
Whereas don't take inositol every night so, find wake


middle night, bit challenge fall back asleep. inositol
number different uses discussed terms mental health
terms adjusting anxiety daytime use. talking taking 900
milligrams myo-inositol also 30 60 minutes sleep along standard
sleep stack found immensely beneficial. also noticed pretty
long tail anxiety suppression throughout day. not somebody suffers
anxiety, say just led feel bit calmer throughout day,

01:22:55 Staying Asleep: Eye Masks, Ear Plugs, Elevating Feet

back asleep within minutes don't wake morning. Now, briefly, just
want touch tools commonly used many people there,
believe not, peer-reviewed science things like eye masks. eye
masks improve ability stay asleep? indeed, do, provided not
tight provided room cool enough. Why? Well, eye masks cover
upper half face, glabrous skin localized. Remember, palms
hands, bottoms feet, glabrous skin face. lot people wear
eye masks will wake warm room warm.
going use eye mask keep light out, definitely make sure room
sleeping environment bed cool enough order stay asleep.
addition, get lot questions earplugs. deal earplugs.
people find earplugs beneficial because, course, prevent
entrance sound ear wake us up. people find
sound beating heart can disruptive get sort
humming head earplugs in. one person.


Although, family members like using earplugs sleep. really
you. see whether not earplugs help disrupt sleep.
me, no good. people, really enjoy them. don't use eye mask
unless sleeping really bright environment need sleep plane
things sort. tools just mention peer-reviewed research
support them. Elevating feet either pillow elevating end bed
three five degrees can really beneficial increasing depth sleep
so-called glymphatic washout. movement circulation
fluids brain night lead wakefulness actually can improve
cognitive function number things related brain health. one
caveat that. people suffer acid reflux, ankles elevated
chest heart middle night can actually exacerbate
acid reflux. want opposite. want actually elevate head side
bed

01:24:58 Tool: Sleep Apnea & Nasal Breathing

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag

instance, need stay really late one night wake especially early, like 3:00 a.m.,
prepare exam just not ready head airport, et cetera,
using red light shown allow people awake enough obviously see

three five degrees. Now, one common causes sleep disruption
tremendously detrimental effects so-called sleep apnea. basically bouts
suffocation lack oxygenation sleep. particularly case people
heavyset, heavyset obesity, also
heavyset much muscle. lot people carrying much
muscle will actually sleep apnea without realizing it. Sleep apnea actually
dangerous. associated number cardiovascular issues. associated
sexual dysfunction. associated issues cognition. Sleep apnea bad. lot
people will use PAP, a, device. looks like sort like
snorkel mask dive mask. whole apparatus people will go sleep with.
However, many people can relieve sleep apnea provided not
serious can sleep much better, fact, think people can sleep much better,
train nose breathers sleep. lot reasons
nose breather unless breathing hard due exercise talking
eating. covered James Nestor's book, "Breath: New Science
Lost Art." covered number different podcasts. talked
podcast well. good idea nose breather unless need mouth


breathe. great idea, superb idea, nose breather sleep. one
way really get good take little bit medical tape tape mouth
shut going sleep. heard right. Put medical tape mouth
force nose breathe sleep. also prevents snoring cases.
Really offsets sleep apnea. Sleep apnea, again, serious health concern.
also mention tool hard time nose breather
sleep, can try cardiovascular exercise, least lower-intensity
cardiovascular exercise, purely nasal breathing. one way that, again,
tape mouth shut put gulp water mouth, don't actually
swallow mouth full water, use mouthpiece just deliberately keep
mouth closed insist breathing nose. people find
start cardiovascular exercise way, really challenging first,
time, actually can feel quite calm still can generate lot physical effort purely
using nose breathing. reason nose breathing cardiovascular
exercise translates nose breather sleep sinuses actually
can dilate, plastic, time, plastic meaning malleable is,
can become wider. not going get giant nostrils. Don't worry it.
airways within skull, 'cause sinuses really are, little passages
within skull, and, course, within nasal passages, will dilate will allow
breathe easily nose. waking
middle night breathing back [breathing heavily] partner telling
people telling person plane
mouth hanging open drooling mouth breathing, terrible, terrible, terrible
health reasons reasons, put medical tape mouth, learn
nose breather sleep. sleep will improve daytime feelings
wakefulness focus will improve, cardiovascular health will improve,
on. now largely covered tools one use get stay
asleep, talked exercise, talked temperature, talked
supplements, talked about, course,

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple
final points additional tools think going useful everybody,
particular, people young children following shift work schedule
experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
doesn't know difference flying new time zone getting woken
middle night. tool like offer understanding
something called temperature minimum. going make simple
possible confident everyone can understand even don't
science background. question need ask yourself. typical
wake-up time, okay? typical wake-up time? you, typical wake-up
time 7:00 a.m. plus minus half hour, 7:00 a.m.
set alarm clock 7:00 a.m. naturally wake 7:00 a.m.,
doesn't matter, typical wake-up time days 7:00 a.m., well,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m. right, temperature minimum not
temperature. time within 24-hour cycle. Approximately two hours
typical wake-up time, body lowest temperature will ever 24-
hour cycle. called temperature minimum. need
know temperature minimum. view bright light, exercise, drink
caffeine two four hours temperature minimum,
will delay clock. means say delay clock will make
want go sleep later wake later next night, okay? run
exercise you, person waking 7:00 a.m. regular basis, can predict
almost certainty body going lowest temperature 5:00 a.m..
means get 3:00 a.m. 4:00 a.m. flip bright
lights house bathroom cup coffee kind
exercise get head airport, mechanisms brain
body control timing sleep timing waking will shift. will delay.
put clock hold little let start again, okay?
simplest way can describe it. will tend want go sleep later wake
later following night. Now, opposite true view bright light, drink caffeine,
exercise socialize, say, hours immediately temperature


minimum. example, person waking 7:00 a.m.,
temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., view bright light, exercise, maybe
snack, maybe not, socialize, move about, 5:30 6:00 a.m. 7:00 a.m. will
tend phase advance clock. will tend basically make want go bed
earlier wake earlier following night. Now, used example person
wakes typically 7:00 a.m. whose temperature minimum 5:00 a.m., but, course,
need adjust somebody wakes 9:00 a.m.
5:00 a.m. et cetera. offer tool? Well, immensely powerful
tool if, instance, headed time zone need go bed earlier
wake earlier arrive time zone. means day two
leave, can force exercise, drink caffeine, maybe even eat
meal early morning, maybe still fast early morning really
you, force activities going phase advance
clock. Whereas traveling time zone going need go
sleep much later going need wake much later even little bit later,
can things hours prior temperature minimum. Now,
work shift work, can especially useful, want say couple
things shift work. lot details shift work jet lag
episode specifically jet lag shift work. deep dive, go there,

middle sleep cycle not just quick departure bathroom
back bed, really need awake, know, feeding baby
taking care loved one need something critical need
work, possible, use red light, okay? Now, shift workers really trying stay
awake night sleep day, not going ideal, people that,
instance, need stay really late one night wake especially early, like 3:00 a.m.,
prepare exam just not ready head airport, et cetera,
using red light shown allow people awake enough obviously see

01:28:20 Sleep Schedule Consistency, Weekends, Compensatory Sleep & Caffeine

keeping sleeping environment cool dark possible. want
mention couple broad contour tools will impact ability sleep really well


consistent basis one impacts number people weekends.
Turns everybody feels impulse sleep weekend, especially
late night before. However, data show keeping relatively
consistent sleep wake times really going enhance quality depth
sleep. stay late one night, sure, might allow sleep
extra hour so, really try avoid sleeping longer hour
beyond normal wake-up time. right. normally get eight hours sleep
wake 7:00 a.m., probably okay wake 8:00 a.m. weekend
night night before, try not sleep 11 noon thinking
going catch sleep better waking consistent time.
better wake consistent time plus minus hour get nap
afternoon provided nap, again, isn't long. tool relates
nights stayed late feel like want sleep bit
morning going wake consistent time. example,
normally go bed 10 wake six. say schedule.
end staying late one night midnight one whatever reason
next morning wake seven still groggy. case, absolutely
want wait ingest caffeine 90 120 minutes waking. really
good data support fact caffeine can disrupt sleep. Yes,
obvious. Caffeine especially disrupts sleep take late day.
obvious case. caffeine especially disrupts called
compensatory sleep. start changing waking time sleep time
start using additional caffeine offset sleepiness experiencing
late nights out, well, really start disrupt not just
nighttime sleep, daytime compensatory sleep, naps. also
disrupting total architecture sleep early morning hours. lot great
science put this, emerged this, say. try keep
sleep-wake times relatively constant plus minus hour, try much
can delay caffeine intake 90 120 minutes waking every day,
especially days wake feel haven't gotten enough sleep.
case, highly recommend just use NSDR Reveri app form
deep relaxation try compensate lack sleep, knowing, course,
no complete compensation lack sleep.



01:31:14 Tools: Temperature Minimum & Jet Lag, Shift Work & Red Lights

just things can partially offset lack sleep. Now, couple

experiencing jet lag. Keep mind, jet lag can due travel, obvious,
jet lag can also due getting woken middle night, right? body
