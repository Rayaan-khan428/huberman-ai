Again, interested, please go helixsleep.com/huberman $200 off
two free pillows. fear? Well, fear falls category nervous system
phenomenon can reliably call emotion. hotly debated nowadays.
hotly debated really centuries emotion emotion isn't.
Now not debate want get today. think fair say emotions
include responses within body. Quickening heart rate, changes blood flow,


things experience warming cooling skin. also
cognitive component. thoughts, memories. sorts stuff
goes mind body together call emotion.
vast amount interest literature devoted try understand many different
emotions are, different people experience emotions. certainly
topic will embrace future podcast episode. today just want talk
fear response. talk fear physiological response
cognitive response, can get concrete mechanisms
concrete practical tools can used deal fear fear
not wanted. talk first fear isn't. people familiar stress,
concept experience. Stress physiological response. involves
quickening heart rate. Typically quickening breathing, blood flow getting shuttled
certain areas brain body not others. can create hypervigilance
awareness. Typically awareness narrower, literally narrower space, like
soda straw view world relaxed. fair say
cannot fear without several, not elements stress response.
However, can stress without fear. Likewise, people familiar
phrase word rather, anxiety. Anxiety tends stress future event,
although can mean things well. can't really fear without seeing
observing experiencing elements anxiety, can anxiety
without fear. starting realize fear built certain
basic elements include stress anxiety. trauma. trauma
also requires specific, will call operational definition. operational definition
just definition allows us conversation agree
mostly agree meaning given word is. makes conversations much
easier. fact, argue operational definitions things
world, fewer misunderstandings arguments move
lot species. another topic entirely. operational definition
trauma fear took place, course includes stress anxiety.
fear somehow gets embedded activated nervous system,
shows times maladaptive. Meaning fear doesn't serve us well
gets reactivated various times. Like first wake morning,
not presence something scared you, suddenly feels like
panic attack deep fear. Well, post-traumatic stress. post-


traumatic fear. don't want get bogged much nomenclature
building sort series layers stress anxiety
form foundation calling fear trauma.
phrases remiss didn't mention things like phobias
panic attacks. Panic attacks experience extreme fear without fear
inducing stimulus. kind like trauma. phobia tends extreme fear
something specific. Fear spiders, fear heights, fear flying, fear dying,
kinds things, okay? reason laying not create word
soup confuse us rather simplify issue now acknowledge
many different phrases describe thing call fear
unrelated phenomenon. can start just focus two issues, fear
trauma. relates specific biological processes, specific cognitive processes.
can start dissect fears formed,

00:11:45 Autonomic Arousal: “Alertness” vs. “Calmness”

fears unformed new memories can come replace previously fearful
experiences. effort establish common language around fear trauma,
want point autonomic arousal. Autonomic arousal relates aspect
nervous system, call autonomic nervous system. Autonomic means
automatic somewhat misnomer, aspects autonomic
nervous system can control. autonomic nervous system controls things
like digestion, urination, sexual behavior, stress. want awake,
want asleep, basically two branches it. Two branches, meaning two
different systems. One so-called sympathetic autonomic nervous system.
nothing sympathy, everything increasing alertness. Think
sympathetic nervous system alertness nervous system. ramps
levels alertness, ramps levels vigilant. Think
accelerator alertness attention. branch autonomic nervous

calming. acts sort seesaw adjust overall level alertness.


instance, right now alert, feel pretty calm. not ready go sleep
anything like that. don't feel like need nap. alert, calm. not state

parasympathetic feel wide awake. sleepy, opposite true.
parasympathetic side increased relative sympathetic side.
many different aspects autonomic nervous system, one main aspects

00:13:44 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis)

going come today, important
understand is. called HPA axis. HPA axis stands Hypothalamic-
Pituitary-Adrenal Axis. hypothalamus collection neurons. area
brain real estate, deep brain base brain contains many,
many different areas control things like temperature, desire sex, desire
eat, thirst. also controls desire not mate, sex, not eat, not drink
water type fluid. accelerators brakes well.
hypothalamus connects so-called pituitary, pituitary lives close roof

release different hormones types chemicals body.
two main ones need know today Adrenaline also called
Epinephrine Cortisol. so-called stress hormones, not

00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits Fear

extinguish fear response replace non fearful associations. dig
little deeper neural circuits biology fear. that, can
start reveal logic attack fear goal. can't discussion
fear without discussing famous amygdala. Famous think
people now heard amygdala. Amygdala means almond. almond
shaped structure sides brain. one right side
brain, one left side brain. amygdala part can call
threat reflex. important conceptualize fear including reflex.
much reflexes cause lift foot just step
something sharp. literally reflex within spinal cord causes lift
one foot extend one toward ground. Believe not, always
think step something sharp pull foot up. actually step


something sharp, pull foot pulling another reflex
activated extend legs don't fall over. Similarly
process experiencing fear, reflex particular events brain
body. reflex involves things like, quickening heart rate, hypervigilance,
attentional systems pop on, increased ability access energy stores movement
thought forth. just like step tack reflex example,
neural circuits associated calm, able go sleep,
able visualize full picture environment, literally see entire
environment, hear things around you. get shut so-
called threat reflex gets activated. amygdala part threat reflect much
can really say, final common pathway threat
reflex flows. words, amygdala essential threat response.
threat reflex threat response kind dumb response. not sophisticated
thing, generic. also important point. One beauties
fear system generalizable. not designed afraid
one thing. Sure, debates probably good data
support fact human babies innately, meaning requires no learning. Innately
afraid certain things like heights, snakes spiders. debate this.
depends quality experiment, et cetera. real capacity fear
system can become afraid anything provided threat system
activated conjunction external experience. way like think
amygdala not fear center, critical component threat
reflex. like also internalize idea threat reflex involves activation
certain systems suppression systems calming parasympathetic
system. now going describe way information flows
threat reflex. that, will reveal specific things, like spider, like
snake, like physical trauma, like car accident, like fear public speaking, whatever
happens scare scare somebody, gets attached reflex.
reflex generic. doesn't really know afraid of. knows
create sensation, internal landscape think fear.
amygdala might look like almond, actually part much bigger complex
collection neurons called amygdaloid complex. complex anywhere
12 14 areas depending who's... neuroanatomist naming things
carving Neuroscience much biology. like joke


lumpers splitters. people like draw boundaries every
little distinct difference say, "Oh, separate area people
lumpers." say, "Well, listen, know complicate things? lump
together." neither lumper splitter, somewhere between. think
number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically
information memory systems, like hippocampus sensory
systems, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, et cetera. taste information, vision,
auditory information, touch, et cetera. Flow so-called lateral portion
amygdala. Flows into... amygdaloid complex. flows lateral portion.
multiple outputs amygdala. things get
particularly interesting outputs amygdala lot different areas,
two main pathways. One involves hypothalamus, heard
collection neurons control lot primitive drives sex,
food, thirst warmth, et cetera. also feeds adrenals.
glands learned minutes ago create sense alertness
action. also feeds mean feeds out, way, neurons
send wires. call wires axons connections. can release chemicals
trigger activation different brain areas. feeds brain areas
PAG. PAG interesting discussion today.
periaqueductal gray. periaqueductal gray contains neurons can trigger freezing,
can trigger the... people talk fawning response, kind
appeasing response traumatic events. people outright freeze response
fear, right? heard fight flight. indeed pathway describing can
create sense fight cause people want lean in, aggressive way
combat things afraid flight run away. Essentially avoid
mobilizing thing feel threatened by. Now, even absence
threat, somebody say fear public speaking might hesitate move
away podium hesitate move away raising hand. raising
hand meant might called public speaking. fight
flight, also freeze response. freeze response controlled


number brain centers, periaqueductal gray, PAG, central
freeze response neurons. also create called Endogenous opioids.
Many heard opioid crisis, crisis prescription medication
given broadly people don't need it, become addicted opioids.
Exogenous opioid. Endogenous opioids chemicals released
neurons PAG elsewhere body give us sense numbing.
actually numb us pain. can imagine biology
organized way. threat occurs something perceive threat,
afraid it. natural analgesic released body likely

Endogenous release opioids occurring PAG.
area again, sorry litter conversation names structures,
people seem enjoy knowing structures. fine just understand
structures do. want know names fine. structure
locus coeruleus. locus coeruleus creates sense arousal, releasing
Adrenaline, Epinephrine Norepinephrine, related chemical brain.
basically activation amygdaloid complex number different
things, memory something fearful. actual sensory experience something

one pathway amygdala. pathway amygdala
interesting area typically associated reward even addiction.
might come surprise many you. fact, came surprise me.
remember data published, amygdala complex actually projects
areas Dopamine system. so-called nucleus accumbens, mesolimbic
reward pathway, want look remember
Dopamine episodes. pathways brain associated pursuit,
motivation reward. neuromodulator Dopamine largely responsible
feeling craving, pursuit reward. threat center actually able
communicate activate Dopamine system. later will realize
important can leverage Dopamine system order wire new
memories replace fearful ones. hitting lot names things,


moment, even interested Neuroscience names
structures forth. like just conceptualize circuit
brain, meaning set cells connections arranged following way.
threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,
somebody instance, tend like... like roller coasters, done various things
familiar enjoy sensation Adrenaline body. enjoy
alertness brings hyperacuity brings, many people
don't feel way. fact, people don't like sensation lot Adrenaline
system. makes feel uncomfortable control. will
entire episode Adrenaline Adrenaline junkies Adrenaline aversives

system. becomes question whether not remain still, move forward
retreat Adrenaline experience. say Adrenaline experience,
mean threat reflex. fourth component fear really ability attach
narrative, attach meaning attach purpose accounts
purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give
piano recital kid, sit freeze horribly embarrassing.
even just freeze seconds, heart rate increase perspiring,
sweating shame feel leads want avoid playing instruments
public displays performances long period time unless something
overcome it. one trial learning. people, tends accumulation

God forbid decade. feel general sense fear
closeness others, attachment. common fears people
experience. Fears can short-term, fears can long-term, can
medium term. Again, fear system generic. wired include memories
acute, happened within moment, include many, many events
long periods time. kind funnel general sense relationships bad
particular city location bad. key call temporal
component. component fear system able batch many events
time create one specific fear take one specific isolated incident
happened briefly create one large general sense fears. give
example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,
reasons discuss, problem. got belongings taken
decided never coming back San Francisco. isolated incident
forever colored view city. frankly, understanding fear system,
can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,
right? work doctor, psychiatrist, determine whether not
right correct dosage, right you. modulation

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people
reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

chemicals involved social support help extinguish fears.
thing embed mind recognition early traumatic fearful
event detail key forming new non-traumatic association
event person. part one, need diminish old experience.
say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear
trauma go forward. want emphasize diminishing amplitude
physiological response first step. like clearing away association
person, place thing threat reflex. even occurred,
essential need relearn new narrative. essential need
relearn new narrative create new association? Well, fear
reflect circuitry. recall, outputs two areas brain associated
Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new
experiences positive association. going give kind basic
example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't
way. kids just decide don't want cycle
particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,
social events. And, somewhat surprising feature link
back early traumatic experience. not just replacing
bad experience memory good experience memory, actually
holding mind top-down narrative circuits, will. holding mind,
"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice
enjoying despite fact bad car accident. Despite fact two
months ago two years ago, maybe even 10 years ago, couldn't even leave
room didn't want associate anybody." building positive
associations key. linking positive associations earlier
traumatic event key following reason, top-down circuitry prefrontal

connections circuit call glutamatergic excitatory.
activating neurons, like chain reaction. One neuron activates, next
activates, next like dominoes falling. top-down circuits feed threat
reflex parts call inhibitory. tends prevent activation
given circuitries. tends prevent activation threat reflex. acting
break. think positive experiences associated
previously negative experience, not talking forgetting car accident
horrible forgetting assault absolutely dreadful. talking
attaching new positive memory circuitry previous fear response far
less likely occur remains extinguished. just make sure


absolutely clear, first step involves retelling reliving order
extinguish fear trauma, reduce amplitude response.
need replace attach positive experiences earlier
traumatic response. extinction go first, key. can't simply say, "Oh,

sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make

right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new

chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus

system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves

bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking

narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,

fear response. talk fear physiological response
cognitive response, can get concrete mechanisms
concrete practical tools can used deal fear fear
not wanted. talk first fear isn't. people familiar stress,
concept experience. Stress physiological response. involves
quickening heart rate. Typically quickening breathing, blood flow getting shuttled

soda straw view world relaxed. fair say
cannot fear without several, not elements stress response.
However, can stress without fear. Likewise, people familiar

trauma fear took place, course includes stress anxiety.
fear somehow gets embedded activated nervous system,
shows times maladaptive. Meaning fear doesn't serve us well
gets reactivated various times. Like first wake morning,
not presence something scared you, suddenly feels like
panic attack deep fear. Well, post-traumatic stress. post-


traumatic fear. don't want get bogged much nomenclature
building sort series layers stress anxiety
form foundation calling fear trauma.
phrases remiss didn't mention things like phobias
panic attacks. Panic attacks experience extreme fear without fear
inducing stimulus. kind like trauma. phobia tends extreme fear
something specific. Fear spiders, fear heights, fear flying, fear dying,
kinds things, okay? reason laying not create word
soup confuse us rather simplify issue now acknowledge
many different phrases describe thing call fear
unrelated phenomenon. can start just focus two issues, fear
trauma. relates specific biological processes, specific cognitive processes.
can start dissect fears formed,

00:11:45 Autonomic Arousal: “Alertness” vs. “Calmness”

fears unformed new memories can come replace previously fearful
experiences. effort establish common language around fear trauma,
want point autonomic arousal. Autonomic arousal relates aspect
nervous system, call autonomic nervous system. Autonomic means
automatic somewhat misnomer, aspects autonomic
nervous system can control. autonomic nervous system controls things
like digestion, urination, sexual behavior, stress. want awake,
want asleep, basically two branches it. Two branches, meaning two
different systems. One so-called sympathetic autonomic nervous system.
nothing sympathy, everything increasing alertness. Think
sympathetic nervous system alertness nervous system. ramps
levels alertness, ramps levels vigilant. Think
accelerator alertness attention. branch autonomic nervous

calming. acts sort seesaw adjust overall level alertness.


instance, right now alert, feel pretty calm. not ready go sleep
anything like that. don't feel like need nap. alert, calm. not state

parasympathetic feel wide awake. sleepy, opposite true.
parasympathetic side increased relative sympathetic side.
many different aspects autonomic nervous system, one main aspects
aspect

00:13:44 Hypothalamic-Pituitary-Adrenal Axis (HPA axis)

going come today, important
understand is. called HPA axis. HPA axis stands Hypothalamic-
Pituitary-Adrenal Axis. hypothalamus collection neurons. area
brain real estate, deep brain base brain contains many,
many different areas control things like temperature, desire sex, desire
eat, thirst. also controls desire not mate, sex, not eat, not drink
water type fluid. accelerators brakes well.
hypothalamus connects so-called pituitary, pituitary lives close roof
mouth. releases hormones bloodstream. hypothalamus

release different hormones types chemicals body.
two main ones need know today Adrenaline also called
Epinephrine Cortisol. so-called stress hormones, not
always involved stress. also involved waking morning

hallmarks trauma involve fear responses long lasting. Even
fearful events, events world trigger HPA axis can brief,
like car almost hits step off curb something... gunshot

00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits Fear

extinguish fear response replace non fearful associations. dig
little deeper neural circuits biology fear. that, can
start reveal logic attack fear goal. can't discussion
fear without discussing famous amygdala. Famous think
people now heard amygdala. Amygdala means almond. almond
shaped structure sides brain. one right side
brain, one left side brain. amygdala part can call
threat reflex. important conceptualize fear including reflex.
much reflexes cause lift foot just step
something sharp. literally reflex within spinal cord causes lift
one foot extend one toward ground. Believe not, always
think step something sharp pull foot up. actually step


something sharp, pull foot pulling another reflex
activated extend legs don't fall over. Similarly
process experiencing fear, reflex particular events brain
body. reflex involves things like, quickening heart rate, hypervigilance,
attentional systems pop on, increased ability access energy stores movement
thought forth. just like step tack reflex example,
neural circuits associated calm, able go sleep,
able visualize full picture environment, literally see entire
environment, hear things around you. get shut so-
called threat reflex gets activated. amygdala part threat reflect much
can really say, final common pathway threat
reflex flows. words, amygdala essential threat response.
threat reflex threat response kind dumb response. not sophisticated
thing, generic. also important point. One beauties
fear system generalizable. not designed afraid
one thing. Sure, debates probably good data
support fact human babies innately, meaning requires no learning. Innately
afraid certain things like heights, snakes spiders. debate this.
depends quality experiment, et cetera. real capacity fear
system can become afraid anything provided threat system
activated conjunction external experience. way like think
amygdala not fear center, critical component threat
reflex. like also internalize idea threat reflex involves activation
certain systems suppression systems calming parasympathetic
system. now going describe way information flows
threat reflex. that, will reveal specific things, like spider, like
snake, like physical trauma, like car accident, like fear public speaking, whatever
happens scare scare somebody, gets attached reflex.
reflex generic. doesn't really know afraid of. knows
create sensation, internal landscape think fear.
amygdala might look like almond, actually part much bigger complex
collection neurons called amygdaloid complex. complex anywhere
12 14 areas depending who's... neuroanatomist naming things
carving Neuroscience much biology. like joke


lumpers splitters. people like draw boundaries every
little distinct difference say, "Oh, separate area people
lumpers." say, "Well, listen, know complicate things? lump
together." neither lumper splitter, somewhere between. think
number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically
information memory systems, like hippocampus sensory
systems, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, et cetera. taste information, vision,
auditory information, touch, et cetera. Flow so-called lateral portion
amygdala. Flows into... amygdaloid complex. flows lateral portion.
multiple outputs amygdala. things get
particularly interesting outputs amygdala lot different areas,
two main pathways. One involves hypothalamus, heard
collection neurons control lot primitive drives sex,
food, thirst warmth, et cetera. also feeds adrenals.
glands learned minutes ago create sense alertness
action. also feeds mean feeds out, way, neurons
send wires. call wires axons connections. can release chemicals
trigger activation different brain areas. feeds brain areas
PAG. PAG interesting discussion today.
periaqueductal gray. periaqueductal gray contains neurons can trigger freezing,
can trigger the... people talk fawning response, kind
appeasing response traumatic events. people outright freeze response
fear, right? heard fight flight. indeed pathway describing can
create sense fight cause people want lean in, aggressive way
combat things afraid flight run away. Essentially avoid
mobilizing thing feel threatened by. Now, even absence
threat, somebody say fear public speaking might hesitate move
away podium hesitate move away raising hand. raising
hand meant might called public speaking. fight
flight, also freeze response. freeze response controlled


number brain centers, periaqueductal gray, PAG, central
freeze response neurons. also create called Endogenous opioids.
Many heard opioid crisis, crisis prescription medication
given broadly people don't need it, become addicted opioids.
Exogenous opioid. Endogenous opioids chemicals released
neurons PAG elsewhere body give us sense numbing.
actually numb us pain. can imagine biology
organized way. threat occurs something perceive threat,
afraid it. natural analgesic released body likely
interaction uncomfortable. physically uncomfortable. like
Endogenous release opioids occurring PAG.
area again, sorry litter conversation names structures,
people seem enjoy knowing structures. fine just understand
structures do. want know names fine. structure
locus coeruleus. locus coeruleus creates sense arousal, releasing
Adrenaline, Epinephrine Norepinephrine, related chemical brain.
basically activation amygdaloid complex number different
things, memory something fearful. actual sensory experience something
fearful. fear response taking part threat reflex
gets activated. threat reflex sends whole set functions

alertness, activation endogenous pain system anti-pain system PAG.
one pathway amygdala. pathway amygdala
interesting area typically associated reward even addiction.
might come surprise many you. fact, came surprise me.
remember data published, amygdala complex actually projects
areas Dopamine system. so-called nucleus accumbens, mesolimbic
reward pathway, want look remember
Dopamine episodes. pathways brain associated pursuit,
motivation reward. neuromodulator Dopamine largely responsible
feeling craving, pursuit reward. threat center actually able
communicate activate Dopamine system. later will realize
important can leverage Dopamine system order wire new
memories replace fearful ones. hitting lot names things,


moment, even interested Neuroscience names
structures forth. like just conceptualize circuit
brain, meaning set cells connections arranged following way.
threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,
somebody instance, tend like... like roller coasters, done various things
familiar enjoy sensation Adrenaline body. enjoy
alertness brings hyperacuity brings, many people
don't feel way. fact, people don't like sensation lot Adrenaline
system. makes feel uncomfortable control. will
entire episode Adrenaline Adrenaline junkies Adrenaline aversives
future. threat reflex inevitably involves release Adrenaline
system. becomes question whether not remain still, move forward
retreat Adrenaline experience. say Adrenaline experience,
mean threat reflex. fourth component fear really ability attach
narrative, attach meaning attach purpose accounts
purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give
piano recital kid, sit freeze horribly embarrassing.
even just freeze seconds, heart rate increase perspiring,
sweating shame feel leads want avoid playing instruments
public displays performances long period time unless something
overcome it. one trial learning. people, tends accumulation
experiences. bad relationship lasts entire summer, entire year,
God forbid decade. feel general sense fear
closeness others, attachment. common fears people
experience. Fears can short-term, fears can long-term, can
medium term. Again, fear system generic. wired include memories
acute, happened within moment, include many, many events
long periods time. kind funnel general sense relationships bad
particular city location bad. key call temporal
component. component fear system able batch many events
time create one specific fear take one specific isolated incident
happened briefly create one large general sense fears. give
example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,
reasons discuss, problem. got belongings taken
decided never coming back San Francisco. isolated incident
forever colored view city. frankly, understanding fear system,
can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,
right? work doctor, psychiatrist, determine whether not
right correct dosage, right you. modulation
anxiety can indirectly reduce likelihood one will panic attack
experience fear, intense experience fear reliving trauma. SSRIs
not plugging specific mechanism related fear comes
system. indirect support. important goal
modern psychiatry goal modern biology provide mechanistic
understanding leads treatments. need think sorts
treatments tap fear circuits described before. fact
memories attached generic threat reflex response. threat
reflex response can linked Dopamine system can linked
systems

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people

happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically
clinician present. work? Well, basically first heard
EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.
heard argument EMDR activates sides brain, guess hypothetically
thought important somehow. frankly, no evidence whatsoever
EMDR activates sides brain way beneficial. mean, looking

EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative

recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits Fear

extinguish fear response replace non fearful associations. dig
little deeper neural circuits biology fear. that, can
start reveal logic attack fear goal. can't discussion
fear without discussing famous amygdala. Famous think
people now heard amygdala. Amygdala means almond. almond
shaped structure sides brain. one right side
brain, one left side brain. amygdala part can call
threat reflex. important conceptualize fear including reflex.
much reflexes cause lift foot just step
something sharp. literally reflex within spinal cord causes lift
one foot extend one toward ground. Believe not, always
think step something sharp pull foot up. actually step


something sharp, pull foot pulling another reflex
activated extend legs don't fall over. Similarly
process experiencing fear, reflex particular events brain
body. reflex involves things like, quickening heart rate, hypervigilance,
attentional systems pop on, increased ability access energy stores movement
thought forth. just like step tack reflex example,
neural circuits associated calm, able go sleep,
able visualize full picture environment, literally see entire
environment, hear things around you. get shut so-
called threat reflex gets activated. amygdala part threat reflect much
can really say, final common pathway threat
reflex flows. words, amygdala essential threat response.
threat reflex threat response kind dumb response. not sophisticated
thing, generic. also important point. One beauties
fear system generalizable. not designed afraid
one thing. Sure, debates probably good data
support fact human babies innately, meaning requires no learning. Innately
afraid certain things like heights, snakes spiders. debate this.
depends quality experiment, et cetera. real capacity fear
system can become afraid anything provided threat system
activated conjunction external experience. way like think
amygdala not fear center, critical component threat
reflex. like also internalize idea threat reflex involves activation
certain systems suppression systems calming parasympathetic
system. now going describe way information flows
threat reflex. that, will reveal specific things, like spider, like
snake, like physical trauma, like car accident, like fear public speaking, whatever
happens scare scare somebody, gets attached reflex.
reflex generic. doesn't really know afraid of. knows
create sensation, internal landscape think fear.
amygdala might look like almond, actually part much bigger complex
collection neurons called amygdaloid complex. complex anywhere
12 14 areas depending who's... neuroanatomist naming things
carving Neuroscience much biology. like joke


lumpers splitters. people like draw boundaries every
little distinct difference say, "Oh, separate area people
lumpers." say, "Well, listen, know complicate things? lump
together." neither lumper splitter, somewhere between. think
number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically
information memory systems, like hippocampus sensory
systems, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, et cetera. taste information, vision,
auditory information, touch, et cetera. Flow so-called lateral portion
amygdala. Flows into... amygdaloid complex. flows lateral portion.
multiple outputs amygdala. things get
particularly interesting outputs amygdala lot different areas,
two main pathways. One involves hypothalamus, heard
collection neurons control lot primitive drives sex,
food, thirst warmth, et cetera. also feeds adrenals.
glands learned minutes ago create sense alertness

send wires. call wires axons connections. can release chemicals
trigger activation different brain areas. feeds brain areas
PAG. PAG interesting discussion today.
periaqueductal gray. periaqueductal gray contains neurons can trigger freezing,
can trigger the... people talk fawning response, kind
appeasing response traumatic events. people outright freeze response
fear, right? heard fight flight. indeed pathway describing can
create sense fight cause people want lean in, aggressive way
combat things afraid flight run away. Essentially avoid
mobilizing thing feel threatened by. Now, even absence
threat, somebody say fear public speaking might hesitate move
away podium hesitate move away raising hand. raising
hand meant might called public speaking. fight
flight, also freeze response. freeze response controlled


number brain centers, periaqueductal gray, PAG, central

interesting area typically associated reward even addiction.
might come surprise many you. fact, came surprise me.
remember data published, amygdala complex actually projects
areas Dopamine system. so-called nucleus accumbens, mesolimbic
reward pathway, want look remember
Dopamine episodes. pathways brain associated pursuit,
motivation reward. neuromodulator Dopamine largely responsible
feeling craving, pursuit reward. threat center actually able
communicate activate Dopamine system. later will realize
important can leverage Dopamine system order wire new
memories replace fearful ones. hitting lot names things,


moment, even interested Neuroscience names
structures forth. like just conceptualize circuit
brain, meaning set cells connections arranged following way.
threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,
somebody instance, tend like... like roller coasters, done various things
familiar enjoy sensation Adrenaline body. enjoy
alertness brings hyperacuity brings, many people
don't feel way. fact, people don't like sensation lot Adrenaline
system. makes feel uncomfortable control. will
entire episode Adrenaline Adrenaline junkies Adrenaline aversives
future. threat reflex inevitably involves release Adrenaline
system. becomes question whether not remain still, move forward
retreat Adrenaline experience. say Adrenaline experience,
mean threat reflex. fourth component fear really ability attach
narrative, attach meaning attach purpose accounts
purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give

overcome it. one trial learning. people, tends accumulation

experience. Fears can short-term, fears can long-term, can
medium term. Again, fear system generic. wired include memories
acute, happened within moment, include many, many events

particular city location bad. key call temporal
component. component fear system able batch many events
time create one specific fear take one specific isolated incident
happened briefly create one large general sense fears. give
example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,
reasons discuss, problem. got belongings taken
decided never coming back San Francisco. isolated incident
forever colored view city. frankly, understanding fear system,
can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear

recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits Fear

extinguish fear response replace non fearful associations. dig
little deeper neural circuits biology fear. that, can
start reveal logic attack fear goal. can't discussion
fear without discussing famous amygdala. Famous think
people now heard amygdala. Amygdala means almond. almond
shaped structure sides brain. one right side
brain, one left side brain. amygdala part can call
threat reflex. important conceptualize fear including reflex.
much reflexes cause lift foot just step
something sharp. literally reflex within spinal cord causes lift
one foot extend one toward ground. Believe not, always
think step something sharp pull foot up. actually step


something sharp, pull foot pulling another reflex
activated extend legs don't fall over. Similarly
process experiencing fear, reflex particular events brain
body. reflex involves things like, quickening heart rate, hypervigilance,
attentional systems pop on, increased ability access energy stores movement
thought forth. just like step tack reflex example,
neural circuits associated calm, able go sleep,
able visualize full picture environment, literally see entire
environment, hear things around you. get shut so-
called threat reflex gets activated. amygdala part threat reflect much
can really say, final common pathway threat
reflex flows. words, amygdala essential threat response.
threat reflex threat response kind dumb response. not sophisticated
thing, generic. also important point. One beauties
fear system generalizable. not designed afraid
one thing. Sure, debates probably good data
support fact human babies innately, meaning requires no learning. Innately
afraid certain things like heights, snakes spiders. debate this.
depends quality experiment, et cetera. real capacity fear
system can become afraid anything provided threat system
activated conjunction external experience. way like think
amygdala not fear center, critical component threat
reflex. like also internalize idea threat reflex involves activation
certain systems suppression systems calming parasympathetic
system. now going describe way information flows
threat reflex. that, will reveal specific things, like spider, like
snake, like physical trauma, like car accident, like fear public speaking, whatever
happens scare scare somebody, gets attached reflex.
reflex generic. doesn't really know afraid of. knows
create sensation, internal landscape think fear.
amygdala might look like almond, actually part much bigger complex
collection neurons called amygdaloid complex. complex anywhere
12 14 areas depending who's... neuroanatomist naming things
carving Neuroscience much biology. like joke


lumpers splitters. people like draw boundaries every
little distinct difference say, "Oh, separate area people
lumpers." say, "Well, listen, know complicate things? lump
together." neither lumper splitter, somewhere between. think
number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically
information memory systems, like hippocampus sensory
systems, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, et cetera. taste information, vision,
auditory information, touch, et cetera. Flow so-called lateral portion
amygdala. Flows into... amygdaloid complex. flows lateral portion.
multiple outputs amygdala. things get
particularly interesting outputs amygdala lot different areas,
two main pathways. One involves hypothalamus, heard
collection neurons control lot primitive drives sex,
food, thirst warmth, et cetera. also feeds adrenals.
glands learned minutes ago create sense alertness

send wires. call wires axons connections. can release chemicals
trigger activation different brain areas. feeds brain areas
PAG. PAG interesting discussion today.
periaqueductal gray. periaqueductal gray contains neurons can trigger freezing,
can trigger the... people talk fawning response, kind
appeasing response traumatic events. people outright freeze response
fear, right? heard fight flight. indeed pathway describing can
create sense fight cause people want lean in, aggressive way
combat things afraid flight run away. Essentially avoid
mobilizing thing feel threatened by. Now, even absence
threat, somebody say fear public speaking might hesitate move
away podium hesitate move away raising hand. raising
hand meant might called public speaking. fight
flight, also freeze response. freeze response controlled


number brain centers, periaqueductal gray, PAG, central
freeze response neurons. also create called Endogenous opioids.
Many heard opioid crisis, crisis prescription medication
given broadly people don't need it, become addicted opioids.
Exogenous opioid. Endogenous opioids chemicals released

Dopamine episodes. pathways brain associated pursuit,
motivation reward. neuromodulator Dopamine largely responsible
feeling craving, pursuit reward. threat center actually able

important can leverage Dopamine system order wire new
memories replace fearful ones. hitting lot names things,


moment, even interested Neuroscience names
structures forth. like just conceptualize circuit
brain, meaning set cells connections arranged following way.
threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,
somebody instance, tend like... like roller coasters, done various things
familiar enjoy sensation Adrenaline body. enjoy
alertness brings hyperacuity brings, many people
don't feel way. fact, people don't like sensation lot Adrenaline

system. becomes question whether not remain still, move forward
retreat Adrenaline experience. say Adrenaline experience,
mean threat reflex. fourth component fear really ability attach
narrative, attach meaning attach purpose accounts
purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give

even just freeze seconds, heart rate increase perspiring,

overcome it. one trial learning. people, tends accumulation

medium term. Again, fear system generic. wired include memories

particular city location bad. key call temporal
component. component fear system able batch many events
time create one specific fear take one specific isolated incident
happened briefly create one large general sense fears. give
example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,
reasons discuss, problem. got belongings taken
decided never coming back San Francisco. isolated incident
forever colored view city. frankly, understanding fear system,
can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements

recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

00:17:36 “The Threat Reflex”: Neural Circuits Fear

extinguish fear response replace non fearful associations. dig
little deeper neural circuits biology fear. that, can
start reveal logic attack fear goal. can't discussion
fear without discussing famous amygdala. Famous think
people now heard amygdala. Amygdala means almond. almond
shaped structure sides brain. one right side
brain, one left side brain. amygdala part can call
threat reflex. important conceptualize fear including reflex.
much reflexes cause lift foot just step
something sharp. literally reflex within spinal cord causes lift
one foot extend one toward ground. Believe not, always
think step something sharp pull foot up. actually step


something sharp, pull foot pulling another reflex
activated extend legs don't fall over. Similarly
process experiencing fear, reflex particular events brain
body. reflex involves things like, quickening heart rate, hypervigilance,
attentional systems pop on, increased ability access energy stores movement
thought forth. just like step tack reflex example,
neural circuits associated calm, able go sleep,
able visualize full picture environment, literally see entire
environment, hear things around you. get shut so-
called threat reflex gets activated. amygdala part threat reflect much
can really say, final common pathway threat
reflex flows. words, amygdala essential threat response.
threat reflex threat response kind dumb response. not sophisticated
thing, generic. also important point. One beauties
fear system generalizable. not designed afraid
one thing. Sure, debates probably good data
support fact human babies innately, meaning requires no learning. Innately
afraid certain things like heights, snakes spiders. debate this.
depends quality experiment, et cetera. real capacity fear
system can become afraid anything provided threat system
activated conjunction external experience. way like think
amygdala not fear center, critical component threat
reflex. like also internalize idea threat reflex involves activation
certain systems suppression systems calming parasympathetic
system. now going describe way information flows
threat reflex. that, will reveal specific things, like spider, like
snake, like physical trauma, like car accident, like fear public speaking, whatever
happens scare scare somebody, gets attached reflex.
reflex generic. doesn't really know afraid of. knows
create sensation, internal landscape think fear.
amygdala might look like almond, actually part much bigger complex
collection neurons called amygdaloid complex. complex anywhere
12 14 areas depending who's... neuroanatomist naming things
carving Neuroscience much biology. like joke


lumpers splitters. people like draw boundaries every
little distinct difference say, "Oh, separate area people
lumpers." say, "Well, listen, know complicate things? lump
together." neither lumper splitter, somewhere between. think
number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically
information memory systems, like hippocampus sensory
systems, eyes, ears, nose, mouth, et cetera. taste information, vision,
auditory information, touch, et cetera. Flow so-called lateral portion
amygdala. Flows into... amygdaloid complex. flows lateral portion.
multiple outputs amygdala. things get
particularly interesting outputs amygdala lot different areas,
two main pathways. One involves hypothalamus, heard

important can leverage Dopamine system order wire new
memories replace fearful ones. hitting lot names things,


moment, even interested Neuroscience names
structures forth. like just conceptualize circuit
brain, meaning set cells connections arranged following way.
threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,

purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give

fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling

process experiencing fear, reflex particular events brain
body. reflex involves things like, quickening heart rate, hypervigilance,
attentional systems pop on, increased ability access energy stores movement
thought forth. just like step tack reflex example,
neural circuits associated calm, able go sleep,
able visualize full picture environment, literally see entire
environment, hear things around you. get shut so-
called threat reflex gets activated. amygdala part threat reflect much
can really say, final common pathway threat
reflex flows. words, amygdala essential threat response.
threat reflex threat response kind dumb response. not sophisticated
thing, generic. also important point. One beauties
fear system generalizable. not designed afraid
one thing. Sure, debates probably good data
support fact human babies innately, meaning requires no learning. Innately
afraid certain things like heights, snakes spiders. debate this.
depends quality experiment, et cetera. real capacity fear
system can become afraid anything provided threat system
activated conjunction external experience. way like think
amygdala not fear center, critical component threat
reflex. like also internalize idea threat reflex involves activation
certain systems suppression systems calming parasympathetic

threat reflex. that, will reveal specific things, like spider, like
snake, like physical trauma, like car accident, like fear public speaking, whatever
happens scare scare somebody, gets attached reflex.
reflex generic. doesn't really know afraid of. knows
create sensation, internal landscape think fear.
amygdala might look like almond, actually part much bigger complex
collection neurons called amygdaloid complex. complex anywhere
12 14 areas depending who's... neuroanatomist naming things

lumpers splitters. people like draw boundaries every
little distinct difference say, "Oh, separate area people
lumpers." say, "Well, listen, know complicate things? lump
together." neither lumper splitter, somewhere between. think
number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically
information memory systems, like hippocampus sensory

auditory information, touch, et cetera. Flow so-called lateral portion
amygdala. Flows into... amygdaloid complex. flows lateral portion.
multiple outputs amygdala. things get
particularly interesting outputs amygdala lot different areas,
two main pathways. One involves hypothalamus, heard

threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,
somebody instance, tend like... like roller coasters, done various things
familiar enjoy sensation Adrenaline body. enjoy
alertness brings hyperacuity brings, many people
don't feel way. fact, people don't like sensation lot Adrenaline

entire episode Adrenaline Adrenaline junkies Adrenaline aversives
future. threat reflex inevitably involves release Adrenaline
system. becomes question whether not remain still, move forward
retreat Adrenaline experience. say Adrenaline experience,
mean threat reflex. fourth component fear really ability attach
narrative, attach meaning attach purpose accounts
purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give
piano recital kid, sit freeze horribly embarrassing.
even just freeze seconds, heart rate increase perspiring,
sweating shame feel leads want avoid playing instruments
public displays performances long period time unless something
overcome it. one trial learning. people, tends accumulation
experiences. bad relationship lasts entire summer, entire year,
God forbid decade. feel general sense fear
closeness others, attachment. common fears people
experience. Fears can short-term, fears can long-term, can
medium term. Again, fear system generic. wired include memories
acute, happened within moment, include many, many events
long periods time. kind funnel general sense relationships bad
particular city location bad. key call temporal
component. component fear system able batch many events
time create one specific fear take one specific isolated incident
happened briefly create one large general sense fears. give
example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,
reasons discuss, problem. got belongings taken
decided never coming back San Francisco. isolated incident
forever colored view city. frankly, understanding fear system,
can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,
right? work doctor, psychiatrist, determine whether not
right correct dosage, right you. modulation
anxiety can indirectly reduce likelihood one will panic attack
experience fear, intense experience fear reliving trauma. SSRIs

modern psychiatry goal modern biology provide mechanistic
understanding leads treatments. need think sorts
treatments tap fear circuits described before. fact

systems

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people
reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

chemicals involved social support help extinguish fears.
thing embed mind recognition early traumatic fearful
event detail key forming new non-traumatic association
event person. part one, need diminish old experience.
say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear
trauma go forward. want emphasize diminishing amplitude
physiological response first step. like clearing away association
person, place thing threat reflex. even occurred,
essential need relearn new narrative. essential need
relearn new narrative create new association? Well, fear
reflect circuitry. recall, outputs two areas brain associated
Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new
experiences positive association. going give kind basic
example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't
way. kids just decide don't want cycle
particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,
social events. And, somewhat surprising feature link
back early traumatic experience. not just replacing
bad experience memory good experience memory, actually
holding mind top-down narrative circuits, will. holding mind,
"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice
enjoying despite fact bad car accident. Despite fact two
months ago two years ago, maybe even 10 years ago, couldn't even leave
room didn't want associate anybody." building positive
associations key. linking positive associations earlier
traumatic event key following reason, top-down circuitry prefrontal
cortex threat reflex circuit not like connections circuit.
connections circuit call glutamatergic excitatory.
activating neurons, like chain reaction. One neuron activates, next
activates, next like dominoes falling. top-down circuits feed threat
reflex parts call inhibitory. tends prevent activation
given circuitries. tends prevent activation threat reflex. acting
break. think positive experiences associated
previously negative experience, not talking forgetting car accident
horrible forgetting assault absolutely dreadful. talking
attaching new positive memory circuitry previous fear response far
less likely occur remains extinguished. just make sure


absolutely clear, first step involves retelling reliving order
extinguish fear trauma, reduce amplitude response.
need replace attach positive experiences earlier
traumatic response. extinction go first, key. can't simply say, "Oh,
know, car accident actually good thing stayed home lot
year got study." can tell also true.
won't necessarily probably won't eliminate fear traumatic association
car accident. again, using car accidents general example generic
example here, okay? three-part process. One diminished old experience
repetitive narrative. almost inevitably initial repetition going

turning terrible really upsetting story terrible boring story. extinction

that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.

little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything

recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got

number 12 good number terms number different areas amygdala.
important us? Well, turns amygdala not just area
threat, area generating threat reflexes integrates lots different types
information. want know, going give names,
nomenclature, don't, can tune this. basically

moment, even interested Neuroscience names
structures forth. like just conceptualize circuit
brain, meaning set cells connections arranged following way.
threat reflex can activated time easily, activates
threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat
response, freezing pain management alertness.

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override
number internal reflexes, including threat reflex. way
giving new story new narrative experience call threat.
know threat response, threat response quickening heart rate, quickening
breathing. don't generally like feeling Adrenaline system.
people so-called Adrenaline junkies, get mixture Dopamine
Adrenaline certain high intensity events. confess previous aspects life,
tended like Adrenaline. don't think extreme thrill seeking,

retreat Adrenaline experience. say Adrenaline experience,
mean threat reflex. fourth component fear really ability attach
narrative, attach meaning attach purpose accounts
purposes, generic response. no negotiating fear feels like.
negotiating means. negotiating whether not persist, whether
not pause whether not retreat.

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.
language memories protective memories dangerous context fear
not something said, really something lifted Dr. Ressler one
many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear
system memory system. designed embed memory certain previous
experiences us. threat reflex activated anticipation might
happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give
piano recital kid, sit freeze horribly embarrassing.
even just freeze seconds, heart rate increase perspiring,
sweating shame feel leads want avoid playing instruments
public displays performances long period time unless something
overcome it. one trial learning. people, tends accumulation
experiences. bad relationship lasts entire summer, entire year,
God forbid decade. feel general sense fear
closeness others, attachment. common fears people
experience. Fears can short-term, fears can long-term, can
medium term. Again, fear system generic. wired include memories
acute, happened within moment, include many, many events
long periods time. kind funnel general sense relationships bad
particular city location bad. key call temporal
component. component fear system able batch many events
time create one specific fear take one specific isolated incident
happened briefly create one large general sense fears. give
example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,
reasons discuss, problem. got belongings taken
decided never coming back San Francisco. isolated incident
forever colored view city. frankly, understanding fear system,
can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive
response. something rarely discussed scientific literature,


certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,
right? work doctor, psychiatrist, determine whether not
right correct dosage, right you. modulation
anxiety can indirectly reduce likelihood one will panic attack
experience fear, intense experience fear reliving trauma. SSRIs
not plugging specific mechanism related fear comes
system. indirect support. important goal
modern psychiatry goal modern biology provide mechanistic
understanding leads treatments. need think sorts
treatments tap fear circuits described before. fact

systems

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people
reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

chemicals involved social support help extinguish fears.
thing embed mind recognition early traumatic fearful
event detail key forming new non-traumatic association
event person. part one, need diminish old experience.
say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear
trauma go forward. want emphasize diminishing amplitude
physiological response first step. like clearing away association
person, place thing threat reflex. even occurred,
essential need relearn new narrative. essential need
relearn new narrative create new association? Well, fear
reflect circuitry. recall, outputs two areas brain associated
Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new
experiences positive association. going give kind basic
example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't
way. kids just decide don't want cycle
particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,
social events. And, somewhat surprising feature link
back early traumatic experience. not just replacing
bad experience memory good experience memory, actually
holding mind top-down narrative circuits, will. holding mind,
"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice
enjoying despite fact bad car accident. Despite fact two
months ago two years ago, maybe even 10 years ago, couldn't even leave
room didn't want associate anybody." building positive
associations key. linking positive associations earlier

previously negative experience, not talking forgetting car accident
horrible forgetting assault absolutely dreadful. talking
attaching new positive memory circuitry previous fear response far
less likely occur remains extinguished. just make sure


absolutely clear, first step involves retelling reliving order
extinguish fear trauma, reduce amplitude response.
need replace attach positive experiences earlier
traumatic response. extinction go first, key. can't simply say, "Oh,
know, car accident actually good thing stayed home lot
year got study." can tell also true.
won't necessarily probably won't eliminate fear traumatic association
car accident. again, using car accidents general example generic
example here, okay? three-part process. One diminished old experience

01:05:28 EMDR: Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing

indeed can form completely new relationships things time.

licensed clinicians can carry one several types therapies.
get lot questions forms therapy. One ones comes lot
so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically
clinician present. work? Well, basically first heard
EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.
heard argument EMDR activates sides brain, guess hypothetically
thought important somehow. frankly, no evidence whatsoever
EMDR activates sides brain way beneficial. mean, looking
side side, just way binocular vision circuits organized
will that. never made sense EMDR work several
years ago saw. reviewed no fewer five papers. animal
models, others humans looking lateral eye movements. Meaning moving side
side eyes open, not eyes down. observed
experiments actually, five papers dramatic reduction
activation actually inhibition suppression fear threat reflect circuitry
jaw dropper me. thought, "Wow, actually jaw dropper."
widened that. me, thought, "Oh goodness, maybe EMDR stuff works
according mechanism. maybe mechanism." indeed many
laboratories, not mine, many laboratories now pursuing idea. looking
likely. happen? Well, just briefly, lateralized eye movements
sort describing moving hand like just
eyes even though little embarrassing that. Cause know looks strange,
don't mind cause EMDR EMDR reduces activation amygdala
related circuitries reduces anxiety reduces amplitude threat reflex.
Reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal. words, feel calmer feel less
alert, less stressed moving eyes side side. just heard story
sorts eye movements ambulating,
moving space, sort self-generated motion. one can make


pretty reasonable story evolutionary context ecological context forward
movement fear generally incompatible one another. generally fear

usually trained advance response fear first responders forth.
people freeze retreat afraid. Forward movement generates eye
movements. seem suppress activation threat reflex amygdala
particular. many EMDR practitioners papers think great
celebration. think now increasing excitement EMDR
psychiatric psychological community utility, treating fear, trauma
PTSD. However, point discussing EMDR various colleagues
mine Stanford elsewhere, told EMDR shown beneficial
particular single event type traumas fearful experiences. Not much
relieving trauma feelings fear associated. instance, entire bad
marriage entire childhood. single acute events can
described within kind brief narrative. Brief, not necessarily time,
car accident, bad interaction another individual, assault, God forbid,
sorts things. realize weeds topics unpleasant.
great sensitivity think also important realistic
kinds things traumatize people. EMDR useful? Well, seems like
works single event kind constrained event type traumas people can
describe moving eyes side side generally presence
clinician. However, think back model extinguish replace
trauma fear, remember diminish old experience amplitude
that. need to... extinguish portion. need relearn new
narrative attach reward old traumatic event. EMDR really taps
extinction physiological response old experience. sure
EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative
reward, heard less seen fewer peer-reviewed papers that.
think logically. say, indeed case sitting
chair moving eyes side side deliberately period time reduces
activation threat reflex. patient case, recites repeats

best first time done huge amplitude response.


successive repeat response threat response gets lower lower. EMDR,
sort short circuiting kind sneaking around corner high

EMDR practitioners please correct me, least knowledge, isn't
active component EMDR relearning new narrative attaching reward. Now
reward attaching reward requires somewhat high amplitude sympathetic arousal.
requires feeling victory arousal, okay? positive arousal, not negative

Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads

discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new

chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just

bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,

threat reflex can depend two things. One prior memories coming brain areas
involved storage memories, can immediate experiences. Things
happening now, okay? something fearful happen right now, threat
reflux activated. remember something scary happened
past? threat reflex activated. threat reflex circuit
two major outputs. One major outputs areas involved threat

00:28:24 Controlling Fear: Top-Down Processing

major output areas involved reward, motivation reinforcement,
okay? fourth component. promise last component
need put picture neural circuits fear. circuit
involves area brain called prefrontal cortex subdivision.
literally front. involved call top-down processing. Top-down
processing way prefrontal cortex areas brain can control
suppress reflex, okay? good example step tack
example gave before. step tack, immediately pull
foot extend leg. reflex prevents injuring
falling over. However, wanted, not want to.
wanted, instance, place foot onto tack decide not pull
foot away. difficult. again, don't recommend that,
override reflex, okay? examples reflexes, like
instance, getting cold water, people will start huddle body. people
won't want get cold water. Many people will jump out.
reflexive. want to, override reflex top-down
processing. tell yourself, "Oh, heard previous Huberman Lab Podcast,
Instagram post cold water exposure can beneficial metabolism
resilience, et cetera." indeed can, can decide get water
stretch body, not huddle, can fight reflexes, okay? fighting


reflex carried top-down processing, largely prefrontal
cortex. provide narrative. tell yourself, "I want this.
even though don't want to, going anyway." top-down processing not
just getting cold water, certainly isn't overriding reflexes can
damage us like stepping tack example. way can override

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times
podcast, including important super interesting work transgenerational
passage trauma. absolutely world-class biologist, absolutely world-class
clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us
immediate circumstance also protecting us future
important need ability anticipate. describes memories
protective memories dangerous. know, memories, even evoke
sense fear us protective. protect us making bad mistakes
get us injured killed, put us really horrible circumstances. memories
dangerous create sense us discomfort, tend limit
behavior ways maladaptive. prevent us healthy relationships
others, healthy job relationships, healthy relationship ourselves, frankly.

many impressive lectures. important aspect fear much fear

happen, okay? talk second certain memories

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now
understand classical conditioning called occurs. go give
piano recital kid, sit freeze horribly embarrassing.
even just freeze seconds, heart rate increase perspiring,

example latter, just kind flesh little bit. friend come visit
San Francisco years ago, car got broken into. Unfortunately,
frequent occurrence San Francisco even middle day. Never leave
anything car San Francisco break in, middle day, doesn't
matter. Police can coffee right front still it,

can understand. can isolated incidents wick broad decisions
entire places, can many experiences funnel specific isolated
fears particular circumstances,

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening

that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive

certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,
right? work doctor, psychiatrist, determine whether not

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling

reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new

example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't

particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements

heightened state

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere

cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,

reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even

don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long

Memories experience troubling, physiological responses

clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress

treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put

gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event

really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely

boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian

showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight

sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large

actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling

system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects

00:32:27 Narratives: “Protective Dangerous”

usually point podcast think people start asking, "Okay, well,
biology, mechanism, logic. eliminate fear?"
Well, not quite simple. Although understanding logic mechanisms
circuits built, can eventually get place. want plant
flag around particular type tool logical framework around particular set tools


rather, going build episode. based now
know threat reflex gets input outputs subject top-
processing events, narratives. asking yourself, sort
narratives apply eliminate fear? Well, first take step back just
acknowledged reality, fear cases, adaptive response.
don't want people eliminating fears can get injured killed, right? reason
fear threat response reflex exists help us dying, help us
making really bad decisions. just happens number things happened
us not lethal, don't harm us, harm us inside. think
borrowing language excellent researcher done important
work area Harvard. name Dr. Kerry Ressler. medical doctor
PhD, MD-PhD. chief scientific officer McLean Hospital.
professor psychiatry Harvard Medical School, done extensive
important work fear. going refer back Dr. Ressler's work several times

clinician. Dr. Ressler described fear containing historical
component. not just readiness things might injure us kill us

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense

NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA

brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening
connections associate person, place thing threat reflex. Subsequent
that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive

certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling

reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear

number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just

actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not

extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good

that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make

right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new

chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,

treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus

system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

00:35:58 Attaching Fear Events: Classical Conditioning & Memory



get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long
[indistinct] experience fear, like trouble sleeping night following night.
Memories experience troubling, physiological responses
troubling. Essentially gets wired fear one trial. quite different
forms neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity, course, just nervous


system's ability change response experience. forms neuroplasticity like
learning language, learning music, learning math, take while. don't
generally get one trial learning positive neutral experiences. get one trial
learning negative experiences. asymmetry wired. now

00:41:45 Fear Learning Occurs: Long Term Potentiation, NMDA



places things. like think now pretty good understanding
circuits underlie threat reflex, fear response, top-down
control, meaning can attach narrative fear response. fear
response can learned association particular events, okay? haven't really
talked learning occurs. just want take moment describe
leads right discussion eliminate fears, indeed
replace fears positive experiences. process nervous
system call neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity broadly defined nervous
system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,
snake, public speaking, trauma, horrible experience, wiring fear
system. talking change synaptic strengths. talking
neurons previously not communicate well, communicating well. like
going old school dial connection, even old school telephone connection
Morse code connection communication high speed ethernet, okay? 5G
connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking
slot neuron. neuron gets activated strongly like intense
event example friend, intense event. Almost certainly activated
NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series
signals within neurons change neurons. changes genes


express, shuttles parking spots surface cells
communication cells becomes easier, becomes faster. way think
NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used
creating new associations nervous system. activation NMDA
receptor LTP, involves things may heard like,
brain-derived neurotrophic factor calcium entry, things can leave
discussion future time. basically whole cascade events happen within cells
make just even mere thought something somebody event
happened able activate threat reflex, okay? long-term potentiation one
main mechanisms take formerly innocuous irrelevant events,
make scary. make traumatic. neurons mechanisms
this. Now, fortunately, NMDA receptor long-term potentiation can also run
whole system reverse. can get called long-term depression,
doesn't anything depression associated low mood.
talking weakening connections. can go high speed
ethernet connection neurons, speak, connection like
Morse code, like poor dial connection really weak signal.

00:46:10 Extinguishing (Reducing) Fears

happening extinguish fear, unlearn fear.
now like talk therapies carried humans allow fears
undone, allow traumas reversed, people no longer feel bad
particular person, place thing. Either real interactions person, place thing,
imagine interactions person, place thing. process just mentioned
also involves things like NMDA receptor rather strengthening
connections first thing happen needs weakening

that, will see needs strengthening new experience
positive, okay? key element headed contrary popular belief,
not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive

certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress
disorder. might surprising learn many treatments SSRIs,
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart
beating fast reduce blood pressure, reduce elements
hypothalamic-pituitary axis response talked earlier. Many people
experienced degree relief symptoms anxiety fear PTSD
taking various compounds. Indeed, prescribed broadly.
may find interesting note none current treatments based
neurobiology fear, least not directly, right? People take SSRIs oftentimes will
experience reduction anxiety. depends dosage individual course,

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling

reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't

extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,

"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically
clinician present. work? Well, basically first heard
EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.
heard argument EMDR activates sides brain, guess hypothetically
thought important somehow. frankly, no evidence whatsoever
EMDR activates sides brain way beneficial. mean, looking
side side, just way binocular vision circuits organized
will that. never made sense EMDR work several
years ago saw. reviewed no fewer five papers. animal
models, others humans looking lateral eye movements. Meaning moving side

ideally one still trying access social connection outside specific work-

01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin

including really new exciting protocols dealing fear trauma.
minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided
prescribed board certified physician United States. not certain
areas world. MDMA also sometimes called Ecstasy therapy clinical trials
U S, still illegal drug possess sell. want clear
that. However, MDMA explored potential therapeutic PTSD
forms trauma. course, Ketamine MDMA also explored
chronic depression, eating disorders number psychiatric disorders.
moment just like touch Ketamine MDMA relate fear

gain additional insight might providing sorts relief
early clinical studies starting point to. Ketamine dissociative

Retrosplenial cortex one three hertz rhythms. think important thing just
take away now starting understanding drugs like
Ketamine work create subjective experience patient patients
describe dissociation. know, dissociation essence really not feeling

paper just described, plus review Ketamine-assisted trauma relief might work
somehow allows patient, individual recount trauma feeling
either none different set emotional experiences experienced
actual trauma fearful experience. remapping new onto old. New meaning
new feelings onto old feelings staying exact narrative. little bit
like EMDR suppressing threat reflex seems bring replacement

relearning new narrative, new set experiences next step


described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,
craving, reward. Serotonin typically activated response situations
conditions happy content have. Dopamine
pursuing seeking. Serotonin kind pleasure
satisfaction resources immediate sphere. don't tend to...
Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads
large increases amount Dopamine Serotonin brain body
simultaneously. unique circumstance just simply not seen
normal conditions. subjective standpoint, people influence MDMA
therapeutic setting, tend report immense feelings connection resonance
people even things music, objects. Certainly done conjunction
family member partner therapist, will feel extremely connected
person. feel close understanding association. Oftentimes


goes beyond words. chemical reason that. turns MDMA causes
massive release oxytocin. neuropeptide associated pair bonding
bonding generally. oxytocin system Serotonin system closely linked
one another brain body. tend co-released often
times sorts events. MDMA one mechanism oxytocin
released massive amounts. just relay levels
oxytocin really quite striking, gives kind vivid picture
MDMA make people feel associated positive way various
things happening influence drug.
paper related like highlight journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.

generally lead feelings euphoria inside MDMA session.
Serotonin increases thought lead feelings safety
comfort. again, unusual chemical cocktail never seen least
not amplitude normal conditions outside MDMA clinical
psychotherapeutic session. state mind body potentially useful
treatment trauma? Well, indeed revealing useful
treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new
experiences no drug treatment involved. needs diminishing
old experience, meaning extinction relearning new narrative.
chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like
prolonged exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy seems

related bodies control sorts things eyes open stuff.
think likely next years, things like MDMA certainly Ketamine
already

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got

get attached fear system. brings us beautiful indeed Nobel Prize
winning aspect biology physiology, Pavlovian conditioning. Many
probably familiar Pavlov's dogs famous Pavlovian conditioning
experiments. go something like this. Pavlov experiments ring
bell, dog doesn't much response bell. might attend doesn't
salivate typically response bell. However, pair ringing bell
presentation food enough times, dog will salivate response food.
Eventually take away food, just rang bell dog will salivate
response bell, okay? context so-called Pavlovian conditioning,
things names like conditioned stimulus, unconditional stimulus responses.
People often get mixed can little confusing, just going
make really simple you. unconditioned stimulus thing evokes
response unconditionally. food unconditioned stimulus example just
gave. foot shock loud bang unconditioned stimulus a...
instance say, experiment geared toward exploring fear. unconditioned stimulus
unconditional. unconditionally evokes startle case food salivating.
bell previous example call conditioned stimulus conditioning
stimulus. Sometimes people mix up. condition stimulus paired thing
naturally creates response. eventually condition stimulus creates
response itself. might think, well, just seems endlessly boring simple,
actually way fear systems work. Except unlike Pavlov's dogs,
don't need many, many pairings bell unconditioned stimulus order
get response. can get called one trial learning. circuit
involves amygdala, threat reflex, stuff talking
earlier, system set learning. set create memories anticipate
problems. good system designed keep us safe.
way think many people, one intense experience, one burn, one
bad breakup, one bad experience, public speaking. One bad experience somebody
pet snake whatever happens can cause intense fear moment, long

replace fears positive experiences. process nervous

system's ability change response experience. cellular level, occurs
couple different mechanisms. One main mechanisms something
called long-term potentiation. Long-term potentiation involves strengthening
particular connections neurons. connection sites neurons call
synapses, actually technically synapses gaps connections.
nonetheless, synapses point communication neurons can
strengthened certain neurons can talk neurons robustly
happened before. anytime talk particular event, car,

connection. gets faster, gets robust, very, clear.
happens get long-term potentiation. long-term potentiation involves
couple cellular mechanisms going relevant discussion
treatments undue fear. just throw couple names
cellular elements right now. main one so-called N-M-D-A receptor, N-methyl-
D-aspartate receptor. is, little docking site, like little parking

NMDA receptors related concept protecting property cars,
break car caused NMDA receptor activated. Normally NMDA
receptor not easily activated activated sets off cascade, series

NMDA receptor used sometimes normal things every day,
making cups coffee things like that. often used learning. used

talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event

really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic

say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough

retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get

taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping

boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian

sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful

even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't

not going work simply extinguish fear. One needs extinguish fear
trauma replace fearful traumatic memory idea response positive

certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people
reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

chemicals involved social support help extinguish fears.
thing embed mind recognition early traumatic fearful

say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear
trauma go forward. want emphasize diminishing amplitude

essential need relearn new narrative. essential need
relearn new narrative create new association? Well, fear
reflect circuitry. recall, outputs two areas brain associated
Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new

example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't
way. kids just decide don't want cycle
particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,
social events. And, somewhat surprising feature link
back early traumatic experience. not just replacing
bad experience memory good experience memory, actually
holding mind top-down narrative circuits, will. holding mind,
"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice
enjoying despite fact bad car accident. Despite fact two

less likely occur remains extinguished. just make sure


absolutely clear, first step involves retelling reliving order
extinguish fear trauma, reduce amplitude response.

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements

minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,
craving, reward. Serotonin typically activated response situations
conditions happy content have. Dopamine
pursuing seeking. Serotonin kind pleasure
satisfaction resources immediate sphere. don't tend to...
Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads

treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new

chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking

certainly general discussion around fear trauma. idea
can extinguish fears, can rewire ourselves, can eliminate traumas indeed
can. process involve not just becoming comfortable particular
fearful event trauma, also attaching new positive experience previously
fearful traumatic event. lot different approaches
clinical use try alleviate fear trauma indeed PTSD, post-traumatic stress

selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Things like Prozac Zoloft similar
antidepressants. things like Benzodiazepines, essentially like
painkillers. create elevation certain transmitters brain like GABA among
others. can pain relieving effect. generally however, considered
anxiolytics, reduce anxiety even antipsychotic drugs Beta blockers
sometimes called adrenergic blockers. Drugs designed prevent heart

treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put

gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details

really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely

essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible

threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight

over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing

certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not

extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.

EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything

experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling

system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different

00:50:25 Cognitive (Narrative) Therapies Fear



involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people
reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

chemicals involved social support help extinguish fears.
thing embed mind recognition early traumatic fearful

say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear
trauma go forward. want emphasize diminishing amplitude

essential need relearn new narrative. essential need
relearn new narrative create new association? Well, fear

Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new

example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't
way. kids just decide don't want cycle
particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,
social events. And, somewhat surprising feature link
back early traumatic experience. not just replacing
bad experience memory good experience memory, actually
holding mind top-down narrative circuits, will. holding mind,
"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice
enjoying despite fact bad car accident. Despite fact two
months ago two years ago, maybe even 10 years ago, couldn't even leave
room didn't want associate anybody." building positive
associations key. linking positive associations earlier

less likely occur remains extinguished. just make sure


absolutely clear, first step involves retelling reliving order
extinguish fear trauma, reduce amplitude response.

minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make

right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads

discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus

not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

involved pain, relief anxiety forth. brings us
treatments directly related fear circuitry circuitry related trauma?
primary one begin so-called behavioral therapies. Now, oftentimes
wish think time time specific pill can take
machine device can plug finger can put
headset sudden just rewire nervous system. Fear gone, trauma's
gone, doesn't work way. think language narrative
tool rewire nervous system comparison kinds ideas pills
machines potions, starts seem little bit weak, right? just think, "Oh, well,
talking actually change way respond something?" actually
three forms therapy purely use language
shown strong positive impact, meaning reduce fears traumas.
three prolonged exposure therapy, cognitive processing, CPT cognitive
behavioral therapy. not going go entire literature around prolonged
exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy. will just illustrate
central theme allows work. Now, remember circuit fear,
circuit trauma involves generic reflex. top-down
elements coming forebrain. clear measured
look amount anxiety, pure physiological anxiety response quickening
heart rate, flushing skin, sometimes quaking hands, experience
fear time people recount retell trauma first time
especially recounted lot detail tremendous anxiety response.
Sometimes even great greater actual exposure fearful event
trauma. obviously something done clinician present,
traumatic person. literally reliving trauma full rich detail,
encouraged provide full rich detail. often encouraged speak
complete sentences flush details felt inside, flush details
memories going traumatic fearful event, going it.
really digging nuance contours horrible experiences.
remarkable second third fourth retelling traumatic
fearful events anxiety response amount physiological response,
say amplitude physiological becomes progressively diminished
retelling. Now, might saying, "Well, duh, know, tell


story enough times, eventually wears off." Just like watch movie enough
times hear joke enough times eventually doesn't
impact. [indistinct] case, right? imagine high amplitude
anxiety response, high amplitude activation sympathetic nervous system
retelling actually create even deeper routed fear response trauma
not happens. every clinician spoke anticipation episode
include clinical psychologists, psychiatrists people actually work fear
system biological level said exact thing that, "A detailed
recounting traumatic fearful events absolutely essential order get
positive effects prolonged exposure, cognitive processing cognitive behavioral
therapy." Again, done appropriate support. isn't something
taken lightly mentioned fear response can
long lasting contour it. People can sometimes trouble sleeping
days days. afterwards talk sleep little bit. point
retelling important. idea take terrible extremely
troubling, meaning physiologically troubling, psychologically troubling story, turn
essentially boring, bad story, okay? never really becomes good story
point treatment process describing. terrible event terrible
event period. way retelling event starts uncouple
threat reflex narrative. successive retelling detail
traumatic events, fearful events, threat reflex activated progressively
lower lower amplitude. eventually just becomes really bad, really
boring story. Now one part process getting fear. call
fear extinction. can bring back earlier example Pavlovian
conditioning, many studies done animals humans
showing that, instance, pair tone, bell buzzer foot shock
animal person will brace foot shock. Eventually can just give
bell tone person will experience freezing fight
flight freeze response. conditioned that. give tone bell
over, no foot shock, no pain, human [indistinct]
sometimes foot shocks, sometimes believe not mild burn, even
studies, older studies couldn't now, want to.
eventually happens tone... bell no longer evokes response, okay?
see reversal classical conditioning call reversal


extinction. retelling traumatic fearful narrative, excuse me, fearful
narrative essentially extinction process. Now, done? One can
therapist office face-to-face, sometimes done. sometimes done group type
settings people actually stand sit front group small large
recount detail traumatic experience. sometimes done people writing
experience detail. one effective? Isn't really clear.
literature points fact feeling trust obviously patient
clinician person group essential. people don't access
finances limitations therapy sort. case, journaling
detail shown effective. Although, again, want caution people
reactivating traumas without consideration kinds social support might
need around reactivation. will talk little bit later

00:57:56 Repetition Narrative, Overwriting Bad Experiences Good

chemicals involved social support help extinguish fears.
thing embed mind recognition early traumatic fearful
event detail key forming new non-traumatic association
event person. part one, need diminish old experience.
say diminish, mean, reduce amplitude physiological response. Now
just one approach. going talk approaches eliminating fear
trauma go forward. want emphasize diminishing amplitude
physiological response first step. like clearing away association
person, place thing threat reflex. even occurred,
essential need relearn new narrative. essential need
relearn new narrative create new association? Well, fear
reflect circuitry. recall, outputs two areas brain associated
Dopamine release reinforcement. now know offers capacity
fear circuits circuits underlie trauma mapped onto new
experiences positive association. going give kind basic
example. kind silly example, giving template
number different examples. Example give say kid biking
play soccer, soccer practice, get bad car accident, okay? Terrible thing
happen, survive. recover. somehow... really don't know


certain fear memories get wired broadly narrowly. Somehow kid just
doesn't even want bicycle anymore. actually don't even want play sports.
actually just don't want go anywhere. kind isolating not
interacting friends much all. pretty broad response. didn't
way. kids just decide don't want cycle
particular street. Well, process retelling narrative clinician allow
extinction fear response, right? reduction heart rate, reduction
narrowing focus, reduction things consider fear. really good
cognitive behavioral therapist somebody understands Neuroscience fear
trauma understand not sufficient. really important
child, hypothetical child relearn new narrative don't just manage
bike soccer practice manage spend time friends, actually
start wiring new positive associations biking practice, playing soccer,
social events. And, somewhat surprising feature link
back early traumatic experience. not just replacing
bad experience memory good experience memory, actually
holding mind top-down narrative circuits, will. holding mind,
"Ah, not just biking soccer practice. actually biking soccer practice
enjoying despite fact bad car accident. Despite fact two
months ago two years ago, maybe even 10 years ago, couldn't even leave
room didn't want associate anybody." building positive
associations key. linking positive associations earlier

attaching new positive memory circuitry previous fear response far
less likely occur remains extinguished. just make sure


absolutely clear, first step involves retelling reliving order
extinguish fear trauma, reduce amplitude response.
need replace attach positive experiences earlier
traumatic response. extinction go first, key. can't simply say, "Oh,
know, car accident actually good thing stayed home lot
year got study." can tell also true.
won't necessarily probably won't eliminate fear traumatic association
car accident. again, using car accidents general example generic

licensed clinicians can carry one several types therapies.
get lot questions forms therapy. One ones comes lot
so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically
clinician present. work? Well, basically first heard
EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.
heard argument EMDR activates sides brain, guess hypothetically
thought important somehow. frankly, no evidence whatsoever
EMDR activates sides brain way beneficial. mean, looking
side side, just way binocular vision circuits organized
will that. never made sense EMDR work several
years ago saw. reviewed no fewer five papers. animal
models, others humans looking lateral eye movements. Meaning moving side

widened that. me, thought, "Oh goodness, maybe EMDR stuff works
according mechanism. maybe mechanism." indeed many
laboratories, not mine, many laboratories now pursuing idea. looking
likely. happen? Well, just briefly, lateralized eye movements
sort describing moving hand like just
eyes even though little embarrassing that. Cause know looks strange,
don't mind cause EMDR EMDR reduces activation amygdala
related circuitries reduces anxiety reduces amplitude threat reflex.
Reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal. words, feel calmer feel less
alert, less stressed moving eyes side side. just heard story
sorts eye movements ambulating,
moving space, sort self-generated motion. one can make


pretty reasonable story evolutionary context ecological context forward

usually trained advance response fear first responders forth.
people freeze retreat afraid. Forward movement generates eye

particular. many EMDR practitioners papers think great
celebration. think now increasing excitement EMDR
psychiatric psychological community utility, treating fear, trauma
PTSD. However, point discussing EMDR various colleagues
mine Stanford elsewhere, told EMDR shown beneficial
particular single event type traumas fearful experiences. Not much
relieving trauma feelings fear associated. instance, entire bad
marriage entire childhood. single acute events can
described within kind brief narrative. Brief, not necessarily time,
car accident, bad interaction another individual, assault, God forbid,
sorts things. realize weeds topics unpleasant.
great sensitivity think also important realistic
kinds things traumatize people. EMDR useful? Well, seems like
works single event kind constrained event type traumas people can
describe moving eyes side side generally presence
clinician. However, think back model extinguish replace
trauma fear, remember diminish old experience amplitude
that. need to... extinguish portion. need relearn new
narrative attach reward old traumatic event. EMDR really taps
extinction physiological response old experience. sure
EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative
reward, heard less seen fewer peer-reviewed papers that.
think logically. say, indeed case sitting
chair moving eyes side side deliberately period time reduces
activation threat reflex. patient case, recites repeats
traumatic event fearful event. presence lower

best first time done huge amplitude response.


successive repeat response threat response gets lower lower. EMDR,
sort short circuiting kind sneaking around corner high

EMDR practitioners please correct me, least knowledge, isn't
active component EMDR relearning new narrative attaching reward. Now
reward attaching reward requires somewhat high amplitude sympathetic arousal.
requires feeling victory arousal, okay? positive arousal, not negative

ideally one still trying access social connection outside specific work-

Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

impressive significant effects stress reduction not just respiration protocols
allow people calm also respiration protocols bring people
heightened state

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing

another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic

just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released

predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks

increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma

purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting

done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self

get lot questions forms therapy. One ones comes lot
so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically
clinician present. work? Well, basically first heard
EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.
heard argument EMDR activates sides brain, guess hypothetically
thought important somehow. frankly, no evidence whatsoever
EMDR activates sides brain way beneficial. mean, looking
side side, just way binocular vision circuits organized
will that. never made sense EMDR work several
years ago saw. reviewed no fewer five papers. animal
models, others humans looking lateral eye movements. Meaning moving side

widened that. me, thought, "Oh goodness, maybe EMDR stuff works
according mechanism. maybe mechanism." indeed many

likely. happen? Well, just briefly, lateralized eye movements
sort describing moving hand like just
eyes even though little embarrassing that. Cause know looks strange,
don't mind cause EMDR EMDR reduces activation amygdala
related circuitries reduces anxiety reduces amplitude threat reflex.
Reduces sympathetic autonomic arousal. words, feel calmer feel less

particular single event type traumas fearful experiences. Not much
relieving trauma feelings fear associated. instance, entire bad

extinction physiological response old experience. sure
EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative
reward, heard less seen fewer peer-reviewed papers that.
think logically. say, indeed case sitting

successive repeat response threat response gets lower lower. EMDR,
sort short circuiting kind sneaking around corner high

EMDR practitioners please correct me, least knowledge, isn't

minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,
craving, reward. Serotonin typically activated response situations
conditions happy content have. Dopamine
pursuing seeking. Serotonin kind pleasure
satisfaction resources immediate sphere. don't tend to...
Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads

therapeutic setting, tend report immense feelings connection resonance
people even things music, objects. Certainly done conjunction

oxytocin really quite striking, gives kind vivid picture
MDMA make people feel associated positive way various
things happening influence drug.
paper related like highlight journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.

Serotonin increases thought lead feelings safety
comfort. again, unusual chemical cocktail never seen least
not amplitude normal conditions outside MDMA clinical
psychotherapeutic session. state mind body potentially useful
treatment trauma? Well, indeed revealing useful
treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new
experiences no drug treatment involved. needs diminishing
old experience, meaning extinction relearning new narrative.
chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like

think likely next years, things like MDMA certainly Ketamine

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves

bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,

that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make

right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,

even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements

EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative

discuss behavioral treatments

01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin

including really new exciting protocols dealing fear trauma.
minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided
prescribed board certified physician United States. not certain
areas world. MDMA also sometimes called Ecstasy therapy clinical trials
U S, still illegal drug possess sell. want clear
that. However, MDMA explored potential therapeutic PTSD
forms trauma. course, Ketamine MDMA also explored
chronic depression, eating disorders number psychiatric disorders.
moment just like touch Ketamine MDMA relate fear

paper just described, plus review Ketamine-assisted trauma relief might work
somehow allows patient, individual recount trauma feeling
either none different set emotional experiences experienced
actual trauma fearful experience. remapping new onto old. New meaning
new feelings onto old feelings staying exact narrative. little bit
like EMDR suppressing threat reflex seems bring replacement

relearning new narrative, new set experiences next step


described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,
craving, reward. Serotonin typically activated response situations
conditions happy content have. Dopamine
pursuing seeking. Serotonin kind pleasure
satisfaction resources immediate sphere. don't tend to...
Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads
large increases amount Dopamine Serotonin brain body
simultaneously. unique circumstance just simply not seen
normal conditions. subjective standpoint, people influence MDMA
therapeutic setting, tend report immense feelings connection resonance
people even things music, objects. Certainly done conjunction
family member partner therapist, will feel extremely connected
person. feel close understanding association. Oftentimes


goes beyond words. chemical reason that. turns MDMA causes
massive release oxytocin. neuropeptide associated pair bonding
bonding generally. oxytocin system Serotonin system closely linked
one another brain body. tend co-released often
times sorts events. MDMA one mechanism oxytocin
released massive amounts. just relay levels
oxytocin really quite striking, gives kind vivid picture
MDMA make people feel associated positive way various
things happening influence drug.
paper related like highlight journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.

oxytocin humans. just remarkably MDMA increased plasma oxytocin levels
83.7, average, 83.7 picograms per milliliter. 90 120 minutes
MDMA session compared typical level 18.6. massive increase
oxytocin. think massive increase oxytocin part reason people
feelings close resonance association. Now, Dopamine increases
generally lead feelings euphoria inside MDMA session.
Serotonin increases thought lead feelings safety
comfort. again, unusual chemical cocktail never seen least
not amplitude normal conditions outside MDMA clinical
psychotherapeutic session. state mind body potentially useful
treatment trauma? Well, indeed revealing useful
treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new
experiences no drug treatment involved. needs diminishing
old experience, meaning extinction relearning new narrative.
chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like
prolonged exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy seems

powerful compounds, think future MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy trauma particular holding great promise. now, meaning
time recording podcast. Again, want reiterate clinical
trials done legally. drugs still illegal possess sell outside
clinical trials. sort thing punishable. seem FDA
related bodies control sorts things eyes open stuff.
think likely next years, things like MDMA certainly Ketamine
already

01:39:25 Know Traumatized?

widespread use within psychiatric community. think going seeing

really easy understand. can focus perception external world, events
going around us, beyond confines skin within confines skin.


focus perception external world called exteroception focus

recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal

oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects

so-called EMDR, Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing developed
Francine Shapiro 80s. Eye Movement Desensitization Reprocessing involves
moving eyes side side recounting traumatic fearful narrative typically

EMDR stance vision scientist thought whole thing kind crazy
half-baked frankly. heard theories that, "Oh, recreates eye movements
rapid eye movement sleep REM sleep." completely false. not.
heard argument EMDR activates sides brain, guess hypothetically

minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make

right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new

chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,

think likely next years, things like MDMA certainly Ketamine

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just

cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking

EMDR practitioners thinking attaching new narrative

impressive significant effects stress reduction not just respiration protocols
allow people calm also respiration protocols bring people
heightened state

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing

can pretty slowly people report data point fact
calming. People feel relaxed afterwards relaxation wicks
aspects life. Now, not look stress trauma condition. also
another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic
arousal. fact, can feel right now even brief cyclic hyperventilation
just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released
system. Now not suggesting everyone run this.
predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks

reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves

bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got

inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus

system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got

widespread use within psychiatric community. think going seeing
lot that. One thing not touched yet know
traumatized? know chronic fear debilitating fear? know,
much psychiatric community focuses many problems people might
have. Trouble sleeping, trouble eating, trouble maintaining quality work, schoolwork
forth. certainly valid criteria necessary criteria
determining whether not somebody meets clinical diagnosis not.
biological component think can assess ourselves. one
interoceptive versus exteroception balance. sounds confusing, actually
really easy understand. can focus perception external world, events
going around us, beyond confines skin within confines skin.


focus perception external world called exteroception focus
happening inside us interoception. capacity build mental

laboratory collaboration David Spiegel laboratory, associate
chair psychiatry Stanford. exploring five minute day respiration
protocols can alleviate stress. data not yet published,
stage comfortable talking them. seeing


impressive significant effects stress reduction not just respiration protocols
allow people calm also respiration protocols bring people
heightened state

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing
sleep. carbon dioxide levels bloodstream get high.
get claustrophobic, meaning reflexively.


double inhale nose followed long exhale. it's, [Andrew breathing]
yes, inhales nose yes, exhales done
mouth, ideally. big filling lungs two breaths back
back. Inhales. [Andrew breathing] Even sneak little air
second one, no talking going right. long exhale,
allows offload lot carbon dioxide exhale. people
real time anytime experienced stress particular breathing protocol
giving human subjects repeated... call
cyclic sign. double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale
repeatedly five minutes. actually pretty long time repeat that.
can pretty slowly people report data point fact
calming. People feel relaxed afterwards relaxation wicks
aspects life. Now, not look stress trauma condition. also
another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic
arousal. fact, can feel right now even brief cyclic hyperventilation
just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released
system. Now not suggesting everyone run this.
predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks
time five minutes day two weeks. Intervention
people, support clinician hope, deliberately induce
physiological state stressful, right? Not shying away stress response
increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma
induced psychotherapy session, MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session.
purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting
particular experience. Again, compact five minutes day two weeks
done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self

can help alleviate trauma fear. long this? Exactly protocol
still something needs cultivated. know going
people nonetheless going want experiment this.

self-directed therefore cold shower. ice bath.
anything induces acute, meaning sudden onset Adrenaline self-

01:18:23 Trans-Generational Trauma

going suppress circuits otherwise amplified. next
like talk really interesting almost kind eerie scientific findings.
transgenerational passage trauma predisposition fear trauma.
scientific literature debated many times last really 50 plus years.
recent studies really proven humans capacity
inherit predisposition trauma fear. Now doesn't necessarily mean will
become traumatized experience extreme fear just parents
grandparents experienced that. predisposition, bias. Let explain
papers focus little bit. talk means
us. One important papers area comes us someone

discuss behavioral treatments

01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin

including really new exciting protocols dealing fear trauma.
minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided
prescribed board certified physician United States. not certain
areas world. MDMA also sometimes called Ecstasy therapy clinical trials
U S, still illegal drug possess sell. want clear
that. However, MDMA explored potential therapeutic PTSD
forms trauma. course, Ketamine MDMA also explored
chronic depression, eating disorders number psychiatric disorders.
moment just like touch Ketamine MDMA relate fear
circuitry trauma circuitry described early part episode
throughout episode. think viewing lens, can
gain additional insight might providing sorts relief
early clinical studies starting point to. Ketamine dissociative
anesthetic. right. dissociative anesthetic. main function create

One three hertz just means particular frequency electrical activity. case,
layer 5 neurons Retrosplenial cortex. don't need know much
Retrosplenial cortex one three hertz rhythms. think important thing just
take away now starting understanding drugs like
Ketamine work create subjective experience patient patients
describe dissociation. know, dissociation essence really not feeling
happening. viewing happening different perspective
normally one view experience from. add plug general
notion dissociation Ketamine induced association circuit talked
before, threat reflex involving amygdala. outputs

coming top-down processing. brings us right prefrontal cortical input
threat system narrative. seems case review
paper just described, plus review Ketamine-assisted trauma relief might work
somehow allows patient, individual recount trauma feeling
either none different set emotional experiences experienced
actual trauma fearful experience. remapping new onto old. New meaning
new feelings onto old feelings staying exact narrative. little bit
like EMDR suppressing threat reflex seems bring replacement

relearning new narrative, new set experiences next step


described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,
craving, reward. Serotonin typically activated response situations
conditions happy content have. Dopamine
pursuing seeking. Serotonin kind pleasure
satisfaction resources immediate sphere. don't tend to...
Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads
large increases amount Dopamine Serotonin brain body
simultaneously. unique circumstance just simply not seen
normal conditions. subjective standpoint, people influence MDMA
therapeutic setting, tend report immense feelings connection resonance
people even things music, objects. Certainly done conjunction
family member partner therapist, will feel extremely connected
person. feel close understanding association. Oftentimes


goes beyond words. chemical reason that. turns MDMA causes
massive release oxytocin. neuropeptide associated pair bonding
bonding generally. oxytocin system Serotonin system closely linked
one another brain body. tend co-released often
times sorts events. MDMA one mechanism oxytocin
released massive amounts. just relay levels
oxytocin really quite striking, gives kind vivid picture
MDMA make people feel associated positive way various
things happening influence drug.
paper related like highlight journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.
title paper Plasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA intranasal
oxytocin humans. just remarkably MDMA increased plasma oxytocin levels
83.7, average, 83.7 picograms per milliliter. 90 120 minutes
MDMA session compared typical level 18.6. massive increase
oxytocin. think massive increase oxytocin part reason people
feelings close resonance association. Now, Dopamine increases
generally lead feelings euphoria inside MDMA session.
Serotonin increases thought lead feelings safety
comfort. again, unusual chemical cocktail never seen least
not amplitude normal conditions outside MDMA clinical
psychotherapeutic session. state mind body potentially useful
treatment trauma? Well, indeed revealing useful
treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new
experiences no drug treatment involved. needs diminishing
old experience, meaning extinction relearning new narrative.
chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like
prolonged exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy seems
compacted much shorter session. session performed much higher

high levels Serotonin system probably oxytocin well,
safety written situation allows people lean perhaps
narratives components narratives otherwise holding back from.
powerful compounds, think future MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy trauma particular holding great promise. now, meaning
time recording podcast. Again, want reiterate clinical
trials done legally. drugs still illegal possess sell outside
clinical trials. sort thing punishable. seem FDA
related bodies control sorts things eyes open stuff.
think likely next years, things like MDMA certainly Ketamine
already

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere

Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic

just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released

cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,

reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even

Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided

sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different

right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads

another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic

just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released

predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks
time five minutes day two weeks. Intervention
people, support clinician hope, deliberately induce
physiological state stressful, right? Not shying away stress response
increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma

purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting
particular experience. Again, compact five minutes day two weeks
done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self

discuss behavioral treatments

01:25:00 PTSD Treatments: Ketamine, MDMA, oxytocin

including really new exciting protocols dealing fear trauma.
minutes, like discuss drug treatments starting emerge
potential therapeutics particular PTSD. two drug treatments like focus
Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy, MDMA-Assisted Psychotherapy.
Currently Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy legal. approved, provided
prescribed board certified physician United States. not certain
areas world. MDMA also sometimes called Ecstasy therapy clinical trials
U S, still illegal drug possess sell. want clear
that. However, MDMA explored potential therapeutic PTSD
forms trauma. course, Ketamine MDMA also explored
chronic depression, eating disorders number psychiatric disorders.
moment just like touch Ketamine MDMA relate fear

gain additional insight might providing sorts relief
early clinical studies starting point to. Ketamine dissociative

Retrosplenial cortex one three hertz rhythms. think important thing just
take away now starting understanding drugs like
Ketamine work create subjective experience patient patients
describe dissociation. know, dissociation essence really not feeling

somehow allows patient, individual recount trauma feeling
either none different set emotional experiences experienced

described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,
craving, reward. Serotonin typically activated response situations
conditions happy content have. Dopamine
pursuing seeking. Serotonin kind pleasure
satisfaction resources immediate sphere. don't tend to...
Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads
large increases amount Dopamine Serotonin brain body
simultaneously. unique circumstance just simply not seen
normal conditions. subjective standpoint, people influence MDMA
therapeutic setting, tend report immense feelings connection resonance
people even things music, objects. Certainly done conjunction
family member partner therapist, will feel extremely connected
person. feel close understanding association. Oftentimes


goes beyond words. chemical reason that. turns MDMA causes
massive release oxytocin. neuropeptide associated pair bonding
bonding generally. oxytocin system Serotonin system closely linked
one another brain body. tend co-released often
times sorts events. MDMA one mechanism oxytocin
released massive amounts. just relay levels
oxytocin really quite striking, gives kind vivid picture
MDMA make people feel associated positive way various
things happening influence drug.
paper related like highlight journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.

feelings close resonance association. Now, Dopamine increases
generally lead feelings euphoria inside MDMA session.
Serotonin increases thought lead feelings safety
comfort. again, unusual chemical cocktail never seen least
not amplitude normal conditions outside MDMA clinical
psychotherapeutic session. state mind body potentially useful
treatment trauma? Well, indeed revealing useful
treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new
experiences no drug treatment involved. needs diminishing
old experience, meaning extinction relearning new narrative.
chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus

system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain

One three hertz just means particular frequency electrical activity. case,
layer 5 neurons Retrosplenial cortex. don't need know much
Retrosplenial cortex one three hertz rhythms. think important thing just
take away now starting understanding drugs like
Ketamine work create subjective experience patient patients
describe dissociation. know, dissociation essence really not feeling
happening. viewing happening different perspective
normally one view experience from. add plug general
notion dissociation Ketamine induced association circuit talked
before, threat reflex involving amygdala. outputs
freezing reward accumbens. got prefrontal narrative
coming top-down processing. brings us right prefrontal cortical input
threat system narrative. seems case review
paper just described, plus review Ketamine-assisted trauma relief might work
somehow allows patient, individual recount trauma feeling
either none different set emotional experiences experienced
actual trauma fearful experience. remapping new onto old. New meaning
new feelings onto old feelings staying exact narrative. little bit
like EMDR suppressing threat reflex seems bring replacement
previous emotional experiences sensations body new ones.
way can sort view can try view Ketamine-Assisted Psychotherapy
treatment trauma bringing together three elements talked
before. want diminish intensity, potency old original trauma
experience fear experience. seems accomplished
dissociation maybe kind anesthetic component. reduction
pain body, dissociation, kind observing self leads extinction
trauma fear. also seems automatic kind built
relearning new narrative, new set experiences next step


described earlier. intriguing therapy. one really catching
many, many clinics around U S now it. Whether not
turns ultimate treatment trauma fear isn't clear. colleagues
psychiatry tell unlikely, although seem beneficial number
people. Especially people experiencing trauma existing traumas
fear coupled depressive symptoms. data Ketamine
depression seems quite strong. now talk MDMA. MDMA also
sometimes called Ecstasy Molly recreational form powerful synthetic drug
least far know, creates state brain body unlike
chemical state brain body normally experienced. mean
that? Well, several Neuromodulator systems body. Neuromodulators
chemicals change likelihood certain neural circuits will active.
Meaning can make likely certain circuits will active make
unlikely neural circuits will active. Good examples neuromodulators
dopamine, serotonin, acetylcholine, norepinephrine. tend work different
systems brain body tend activated less parallel,
right? can Dopamine released brain also Norepinephrine. can
Serotonin released brain also Acetylcholine. not none
kind thing, degrees things activated tends vary.
little bit seesaw type phenomenon Dopamine Serotonin.
Dopamine commonly associated activating neurocircuits related motivation,

Serotonin doesn't tend place brain body mode action quite much
Dopamine does, less. MDMA unique compound leads

simultaneously. unique circumstance just simply not seen
normal conditions. subjective standpoint, people influence MDMA
therapeutic setting, tend report immense feelings connection resonance
people even things music, objects. Certainly done conjunction

person. feel close understanding association. Oftentimes


goes beyond words. chemical reason that. turns MDMA causes
massive release oxytocin. neuropeptide associated pair bonding

oxytocin really quite striking, gives kind vivid picture
MDMA make people feel associated positive way various
things happening influence drug.
paper related like highlight journal Psychoneuroendocrinology.
title paper Plasma oxytocin concentrations following MDMA intranasal
oxytocin humans. just remarkably MDMA increased plasma oxytocin levels
83.7, average, 83.7 picograms per milliliter. 90 120 minutes
MDMA session compared typical level 18.6. massive increase
oxytocin. think massive increase oxytocin part reason people
feelings close resonance association. Now, Dopamine increases
generally lead feelings euphoria inside MDMA session.
Serotonin increases thought lead feelings safety
comfort. again, unusual chemical cocktail never seen least
not amplitude normal conditions outside MDMA clinical
psychotherapeutic session. state mind body potentially useful
treatment trauma? Well, indeed revealing useful
treatment trauma. Again, legal clinical trials people
discovering this. seems allow fast relearning new associations
tacked previously traumatic experience. again, brings us back
model people extinguish fears traumas replace new
experiences no drug treatment involved. needs diminishing
old experience, meaning extinction relearning new narrative.
chemical [indistinct] MDMA seems creating opportunity
happen fast without need many repetitions original trauma
reliving original trauma. Probably reliving inside one
MDMA sessions acute, intense, plus seems offering
opportunity extinguish rewrite write new narrative associated
trauma quickly well. means treatments like MDMA


investigation clinical trials unlikely magic potions, will,
allow access particular process otherwise not accessible.
typical process trauma fear reduction carried things like
prolonged exposure, cognitive processing, cognitive behavioral therapy seems
compacted much shorter session. session performed much higher
intensity. Higher intensity chemical [indistinct] brain completely
different. mean, experience MDMA one people
heightened sense euphoria, heightened sense connection. positive
experiences essentially primed written traumatic experience
high levels Serotonin system probably oxytocin well,
safety written situation allows people lean perhaps
narratives components narratives otherwise holding back from.
powerful compounds, think future MDMA-assisted
psychotherapy trauma particular holding great promise. now, meaning
time recording podcast. Again, want reiterate clinical
trials done legally. drugs still illegal possess sell outside
clinical trials. sort thing punishable. seem FDA
related bodies control sorts things eyes open stuff.
think likely next years, things like MDMA certainly Ketamine
already

01:39:25 Know Traumatized?

widespread use within psychiatric community. think going seeing
lot that. One thing not touched yet know
traumatized? know chronic fear debilitating fear? know,
much psychiatric community focuses many problems people might
have. Trouble sleeping, trouble eating, trouble maintaining quality work, schoolwork
forth. certainly valid criteria necessary criteria
determining whether not somebody meets clinical diagnosis not.
biological component think can assess ourselves. one
interoceptive versus exteroception balance. sounds confusing, actually
really easy understand. can focus perception external world, events
going around us, beyond confines skin within confines skin.


focus perception external world called exteroception focus
happening inside us interoception. capacity build mental
appraisal that, right? can instance, stop moment assess
stomach feels, hungry feel, quick heart beating. people
way much better sensing whether not heart beating particular rate
others, not much. people can actually count heartbeats without
take pulse placing pressure wrist neck. people
can't. words, people high interoceptive awareness
people less so. whole business fear trauma relates taking external

fear circuitry. recent paper published journal Science. absolutely
spectacular journal, science, nature cell apex journals scientific
publishing. Gets issue mind assess whether not

really fascinating study. just going highlight little bit touch
relevant aspects can adopted practice assess
reduce fear anxiety. title paper published just weeks ago
Science is, Fear balance maintained bodily feedback insular cortex mice.
not talked much insular, also called insular cortex.

First all, extremely recent. Second all, well grounded current


understanding mechanisms stress, trauma PTSD unlearning stress,

one think going see implemented clinical setting soon
not happening already. Now, fourth reason interested it,
lab works stress, stress-relief tools managing sleep improving
focus, et cetera. one hallmarks studies lately
brief five minute day interventions sort used particular study.
Although emphasize, nothing particular study. Now
particular study carried animal model mice. work laboratory
focuses human subjects. similarities stress system least level

relevance humans. title study is, Repeated exposure short-term
behavioral stress resolves pre-existing stress-induced depressive-like behavior mice.
Again, study mice. basically stressed mice, got
depressed, actually can mouse using restraint protocol.
long lasting restraint protocol, 15 minutes more. Mice Don't like it,

found miraculously, also convincingly. Daily short bouts intense stress
actually undid, reversed effects chronic stress. level
glucocorticoids, hormones, neurotransmitters number different
mechanisms. Now, find exciting number reasons particular,
laboratory collaboration David Spiegel laboratory, associate
chair psychiatry Stanford. exploring five minute day respiration
protocols can alleviate stress. data not yet published,
stage comfortable talking them. seeing


impressive significant effects stress reduction not just respiration protocols
allow people calm also respiration protocols bring people
heightened state

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing
sleep. carbon dioxide levels bloodstream get high.
get claustrophobic, meaning reflexively.


double inhale nose followed long exhale. it's, [Andrew breathing]
yes, inhales nose yes, exhales done
mouth, ideally. big filling lungs two breaths back
back. Inhales. [Andrew breathing] Even sneak little air
second one, no talking going right. long exhale,
allows offload lot carbon dioxide exhale. people
real time anytime experienced stress particular breathing protocol
giving human subjects repeated... call
cyclic sign. double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale
repeatedly five minutes. actually pretty long time repeat that.
can pretty slowly people report data point fact
calming. People feel relaxed afterwards relaxation wicks
aspects life. Now, not look stress trauma condition. also
another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic
arousal. fact, can feel right now even brief cyclic hyperventilation
just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released
system. Now not suggesting everyone run this.
predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks
time five minutes day two weeks. Intervention
people, support clinician hope, deliberately induce
physiological state stressful, right? Not shying away stress response
increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma
induced psychotherapy session, MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session.
purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting
particular experience. Again, compact five minutes day two weeks
done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self
stressing potent tools. sharp blades appear likely
can help alleviate trauma fear. long this? Exactly protocol
still something needs cultivated. know going
people nonetheless going want experiment this.
will say not think matters one gets stressed state provided
self-directed therefore cold shower. ice bath.
anything induces acute, meaning sudden onset Adrenaline self-
directed really key feature here. excited data


five minute intervention data animal study. work ongoing
laboratory Dr. Spiegel's laboratory, work done insular.
think starting see now picture fear trauma PTSD
sensory component, happening world around us. internal
interoceptive component, appropriate signals occurring body?
mean, face it. almost get hit car heart rate 140 beats per
second. lasts little stressed out, don't get best
night's sleep, pretty normal. means healthy fear system.
persists dealing lot issues week later, six weeks later, two years
later. moved realm trauma PTSD. need always
taking account different components circuitry. think deliberate

one people going experiment just again, want caution people

conjunction support clinician. also aware lot
people dealing trauma dealing post-traumatic stress
various kinds.

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing

get claustrophobic, meaning reflexively.


double inhale nose followed long exhale. it's, [Andrew breathing]
yes, inhales nose yes, exhales done

second one, no talking going right. long exhale,

giving human subjects repeated... call
cyclic sign. double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale
repeatedly five minutes. actually pretty long time repeat that.
can pretty slowly people report data point fact
calming. People feel relaxed afterwards relaxation wicks
aspects life. Now, not look stress trauma condition. also
another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic

just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released

cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks
time five minutes day two weeks. Intervention
people, support clinician hope, deliberately induce
physiological state stressful, right? Not shying away stress response
increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma
induced psychotherapy session, MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session.
purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting
particular experience. Again, compact five minutes day two weeks
done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self

can help alleviate trauma fear. long this? Exactly protocol
still something needs cultivated. know going
people nonetheless going want experiment this.

self-directed therefore cold shower. ice bath.
anything induces acute, meaning sudden onset Adrenaline self-

five minute intervention data animal study. work ongoing
laboratory Dr. Spiegel's laboratory, work done insular.
think starting see now picture fear trauma PTSD

mean, face it. almost get hit car heart rate 140 beats per

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere

exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic

just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released

stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing
sleep. carbon dioxide levels bloodstream get high.
get claustrophobic, meaning reflexively.


double inhale nose followed long exhale. it's, [Andrew breathing]
yes, inhales nose yes, exhales done
mouth, ideally. big filling lungs two breaths back
back. Inhales. [Andrew breathing] Even sneak little air
second one, no talking going right. long exhale,
allows offload lot carbon dioxide exhale. people
real time anytime experienced stress particular breathing protocol
giving human subjects repeated... call
cyclic sign. double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale
repeatedly five minutes. actually pretty long time repeat that.
can pretty slowly people report data point fact
calming. People feel relaxed afterwards relaxation wicks
aspects life. Now, not look stress trauma condition. also
another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic
arousal. fact, can feel right now even brief cyclic hyperventilation
just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released
system. Now not suggesting everyone run this.
predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks
time five minutes day two weeks. Intervention
people, support clinician hope, deliberately induce
physiological state stressful, right? Not shying away stress response
increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma
induced psychotherapy session, MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session.
purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting
particular experience. Again, compact five minutes day two weeks
done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self
stressing potent tools. sharp blades appear likely
can help alleviate trauma fear. long this? Exactly protocol
still something needs cultivated. know going
people nonetheless going want experiment this.
will say not think matters one gets stressed state provided
self-directed therefore cold shower. ice bath.
anything induces acute, meaning sudden onset Adrenaline self-

five minute intervention data animal study. work ongoing
laboratory Dr. Spiegel's laboratory, work done insular.
think starting see now picture fear trauma PTSD

mean, face it. almost get hit car heart rate 140 beats per

talked Ashwagandha previous podcast, check podcast stress,
interested might relevant well tools. two
interesting ones. first one Saffron things. 12 studies, believe
not. orally ingested Saffron 30 milligrams seems reliable dose
reducing anxiety standard inventories. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,


want know. significant effects. carried
male female subjects. referring human studies. Several
double-blind studies. meta analysis positive effects.
Meaning anxiolytic affects, anxiety reducing effects things like Saffron.
Definitely check doctor make sure right you.
fairly impressive effects really think given legal
counter substances. Again, check doctor. one Inositol. Inositol
shown create notable decrease anxiety symptoms. fairly high
dose used believe not, potency effect par many
prescription antidepressants. pretty impressive. studies double-
blind studies showed decreases anxiety. done males
females. age range broad, great 18 way 64 across
studies at. One important things dosages quite high 18
grams Inositol taken full month. take time symptoms
anxiety improved. low dose range 12 grams Inositol,
high 18 low 12 grams. again, pretty impressive results considering
counter supplement compounds. even evidence,
just mention Inositol also used things like obsessive-compulsive
disorder. will full episode OCD future, can count that.
meantime, Inositol seem positive effects anxiety. therefore
might provide kind supportive indirect effect people trying work
trauma PTSD. Now, question take it? Well,
logic spelled today, probably not want take

experience recounting experience efforts eventually extinguish
experience, right? put drug compound kind prescription
drug supplement kind system essentially short-circuiting

brief five minute day interventions sort used particular study.
Although emphasize, nothing particular study. Now
particular study carried animal model mice. work laboratory

Again, study mice. basically stressed mice, got
depressed, actually can mouse using restraint protocol.
long lasting restraint protocol, 15 minutes more. Mice Don't like it,

actually undid, reversed effects chronic stress. level
glucocorticoids, hormones, neurotransmitters number different
mechanisms. Now, find exciting number reasons particular,
laboratory collaboration David Spiegel laboratory, associate
chair psychiatry Stanford. exploring five minute day respiration
protocols can alleviate stress. data not yet published,
stage comfortable talking them. seeing


impressive significant effects stress reduction not just respiration protocols
allow people calm also respiration protocols bring people
heightened state

01:49:50 Erasing Fears & Traumas 5 Minutes Per Day

autonomic sympathetic arousal, AKA stress. colleague, Dr. David Spiegel,
MD psychiatrist PhD. Likes say, "When comes trauma, anxiety PTSD,
treatment trauma, anxiety, PTSD, not just state
go into. got whether not anything
it." brings us right back top-down mechanisms narrative around
experiencing internally. zoom explain works
it. brain structure called insular. talked
insular minutes ago. insular calibrating feel internally versus
going externally. involved setting whether not feeling
appropriate given happening. system can generate threat
responses. case trauma, PTSD, extreme stress, chronic stress,
system gets ramped takes little, maybe even just memory maybe
even association not even aware of, location trigger something,
not even aware it. start experiencing symptomology.
recalibrate system? Well, approaches involving drug
treatments, typical drug treatments involve suppressing level internal
arousal. Just trying bring down. Now, drug treatments work.
oftentimes don't. think it, probably not surprising don't
taking drug just lowers anxiety overall creating different
sort miscalibration system. human subjects
either breathing protocols calm them, explain
moment, breathing protocols increase level autonomic arousal
seeing impacts response stress overall not just
particular breathing protocol. calming protocol use involves
physiological size. talked previously podcast elsewhere
just need reminder, haven't heard it. pattern breathing
sleep. carbon dioxide levels bloodstream get high.
get claustrophobic, meaning reflexively.


double inhale nose followed long exhale. it's, [Andrew breathing]
yes, inhales nose yes, exhales done
mouth, ideally. big filling lungs two breaths back
back. Inhales. [Andrew breathing] Even sneak little air
second one, no talking going right. long exhale,
allows offload lot carbon dioxide exhale. people
real time anytime experienced stress particular breathing protocol
giving human subjects repeated... call
cyclic sign. double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale, double inhale, exhale
repeatedly five minutes. actually pretty long time repeat that.
can pretty slowly people report data point fact
calming. People feel relaxed afterwards relaxation wicks
aspects life. Now, not look stress trauma condition. also
another condition people called cyclic hyperventilation,
different creates different internal state somewhat stressful.
five minutes day stress much like study just described. involves
basically this, moment five minutes hyperventilating.
is, [Andrew breathing] not continuously five minutes many
people pass feel extremely uncomfortable. involves inhale, exhale, inhale,
exhale, deep inhale nose, exhale mouth. every 25
30 breaths full exhale holding one's breath, lungs empty
25, maybe 30, maybe even 60 seconds. continuing five minutes up.
Subjects report data indicate people feel heightened level autonomic
arousal. fact, can feel right now even brief cyclic hyperventilation
just did. feel heating up, feel a... people will perspire, people get
wide-eyed, people feel agitated. Adrenaline released
system. Now not suggesting everyone run this.
predisposition panic attack anxiety attacks please don't
stimulating can trigger sorts attacks. five minute day protocol
cyclic hyperventilation lead big increases autonomic arousal. "Stressful"
bring us back colleague, David Spiegel's quote. really said it,
not me. not just state in. state plus
got whether not directed entry state. point
one directs entry state deliberately really key. think


important implications whether not stress relief fear relief trauma
relief bringing oneself state increased autonomic arousal. Why?
way fear trauma circuitry organized. recall, got
components external events can trigger internal stress response fear
response trauma response. top-down prefrontal component can
inhibit certain aspects fear threat circuitry. Now, earlier talking
prefrontal circuit engaged narrative, self-directed deliberate
narrative. person deliberately retelling story? talking
deliberate reactivation sensations body. think going,
meaning laboratory Spiegel laboratory laboratories
taking this. can imagine brief five minutes day, two weeks
time five minutes day two weeks. Intervention
people, support clinician hope, deliberately induce
physiological state stressful, right? Not shying away stress response
increasing stress response deliberately. maybe conjunction
recounting traumatic fearful circumstance. far away different
kind state mind body come Ketamine-assisted trauma
induced psychotherapy session, MDMA-assisted trauma psychotherapy session.
purely narrative based psychotherapy session aimed alleviating fear trauma.
reason like sorts interventions that, A, low cost even
zero cost, right? One imagine journaling recounting
particular experience. Again, compact five minutes day two weeks
done particular mouse study. don't know translates directly
human study not. interesting use longer daily bouts
stress, like 15 minutes day, actually exacerbated trauma exacerbated
fear. one careful. Stress deliberate entry stress self
stressing potent tools. sharp blades appear likely
can help alleviate trauma fear. long this? Exactly protocol
still something needs cultivated. know going
people nonetheless going want experiment this.
will say not think matters one gets stressed state provided
self-directed therefore cold shower. ice bath.
anything induces acute, meaning sudden onset Adrenaline self-
directed really key feature here. excited data


five minute intervention data animal study. work ongoing
laboratory Dr. Spiegel's laboratory, work done insular.
think starting see now picture fear trauma PTSD
sensory component, happening world around us. internal
interoceptive component, appropriate signals occurring body?
mean, face it. almost get hit car heart rate 140 beats per
second. lasts little stressed out, don't get best
night's sleep, pretty normal. means healthy fear system.
persists dealing lot issues week later, six weeks later, two years
later. moved realm trauma PTSD. need always
taking account different components circuitry. think deliberate
self-directed entry short bouts stress promising approach.
one people going experiment just again, want caution people
anxiety panic disorders cautious, probably don't it. Ideally
conjunction support clinician. also aware lot
people dealing trauma dealing post-traumatic stress
various kinds.

talked Ashwagandha previous podcast, check podcast stress,
interested might relevant well tools. two
interesting ones. first one Saffron things. 12 studies, believe
not. orally ingested Saffron 30 milligrams seems reliable dose
reducing anxiety standard inventories. Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale,


want know. significant effects. carried
male female subjects. referring human studies. Several
double-blind studies. meta analysis positive effects.
Meaning anxiolytic affects, anxiety reducing effects things like Saffron.
Definitely check doctor make sure right you.
fairly impressive effects really think given legal
counter substances. Again, check doctor. one Inositol. Inositol
shown create notable decrease anxiety symptoms. fairly high
dose used believe not, potency effect par many
prescription antidepressants. pretty impressive. studies double-
blind studies showed decreases anxiety. done males
females. age range broad, great 18 way 64 across
studies at. One important things dosages quite high 18
grams Inositol taken full month. take time symptoms
anxiety improved. low dose range 12 grams Inositol,
high 18 low 12 grams. again, pretty impressive results considering
counter supplement compounds. even evidence,
just mention Inositol also used things like obsessive-compulsive
disorder. will full episode OCD future, can count that.
meantime, Inositol seem positive effects anxiety. therefore
might provide kind supportive indirect effect people trying work
trauma PTSD. Now, question take it? Well,
logic spelled today, probably not want take
